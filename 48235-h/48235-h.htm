<p>No important change had taken place at Fort Clarke
during our absence. We found there, besides Mr. Kipp
the director,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and his family, two interpreters, Belhumeur
for the Mandan language, and Ortubize for the Sioux; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>former was a half-breed Chippeway, and did not speak the
Mandan language as well as Mr. Kipp.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Besides these men
and their families there were in the fort only six white <i>engag&eacute;s</i>,
one of whom was a smith: some of them were married to
Indian women. We unfortunately missed Mr. Mc Kenzie,
who had left only four days before to return to Fort Union.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
We had received, through him, a very welcome packet of
letters from Germany, which I found here. As I had written
to Mr. Mc Kenzie, requesting him to provide us with a winter
residence at Fort Clarke, in order more closely to study
the Indian tribes in the neighbourhood, instead of accepting
his invitation to pass that season with him at Fort Union,
where we should have been accommodated in a far more
comfortable and agreeable manner, he had had the kindness
to give orders for completing a new building at Fort Clarke,
in which we were to reside. This order unfortunately came
too late, and it was necessary to finish the work in a hurry
in the month of November, when the frost was very severe,
particularly during {413} the nights, so that our dwelling, being
very slightly built, afforded us, in the sequel, but little protection
from the cold. The large crevices in the wood which
formed the walls, were plastered up with clay, but the frost
soon cracked it, so that the bleak wind penetrated on all
sides. Our new house, which was one story high, consisted
of two light, spacious apartments, with large glass windows;
we inhabited one of these rooms, while the other served for
a workshop for the carpenter and the joiner. Each room
had a brick chimney, in which we burnt large blocks of green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>poplar, because, for want of hands, no stock of dry wood
had been laid in for the winter. The consequence was, that
we were obliged to send men every morning, with small
carts or sledges, for some miles into the forest, to fetch wood
for the daily consumption, which in the intense cold was a
truly laborious task. An <i>engag&eacute;</i> who was employed in our
service brought the wood covered with ice and snow into
our room, which considerably increased the cold which we
already experienced.</p>

<p>As our lodging was not habitable for some time after our
arrival, and there was no other room in the fort, Mr. Kipp
received us in the small apartment which he himself inhabited
with his family, and, though our beds were removed
in the morning, yet our presence made it more difficult and
troublesome to find accommodation for the numerous Indian
visitors who came every day. The stores of the fort were
at this time well filled; there were goods to the value of
15,000 dollars, and, in the loft, from 600 to 800 bushels of
maize, which a great number of Norway rats assiduously
laboured to reduce. Some changes had taken place among
the Indians in the vicinity of the fort. At the time of my
first visit, in the summer of 1833, the Yanktonans<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> had expressed
a wish to make peace with the Mandans and the
Manitaries, in which they did not succeed at that time, but
accomplished it in September. Two hundred tents of those
Sioux had then been pitched in the prairie behind the village;
they remained there three or four days, and some
traces of their camp still remained. There had been feast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>ing
and dances, and Fort Clarke was crowded the whole
day with Indians of the three tribes. At this time the prairie
in the neighbourhood of the fort was desolate and deserted;
part of the Indians had already gone to their winter villages
in the forest; many, however, remained in the summer villages,
and we had plenty of Indian visitors during the whole
winter.</p>

<p>Unpleasant news was received from the United States.
The cholera had again broken out at St. Louis, and carried
off a great number of persons. It had been brought, by
the steam-boats, to the trading-posts on the lower Missouri;
at Bellevue, Major Dougherty's post, seven of the ten white
inhabitants had died in a few days.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The major himself
had been very ill, but had happily recovered. Several persons
were likewise carried off at the post of Major Pilcher,
formerly that of Mr. Cabann&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This dangerous disease
had not penetrated to that part of the country where we
were; but, as there was too much reason to apprehend that
it might extend so far, Mr. Mc Kenzie had taken a young
physician with him to Fort Union.</p>

<p>{414} Our first employment was to go on hunting excursions
into the prairies round the fort, which afforded us an
opportunity of collecting the seeds of the dried plants of the
prairie. On one of these excursions, when Mr. Bodmer and
Mr. Kipp had gone out together, they happened to separate,
when a couple of Indians approached the former with their
bows bent, and uttering the war-whoop; he cocked his
double-barrelled gun and prepared to defend himself, when
Mr. Kipp came up, and relieved him from these unwelcome
visitors, the Indians taking flight as soon as they perceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>him. Fresh scaffoldings for the dead were erected in the
vicinity of Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush, several Indians having
died of the hooping-cough, which was very prevalent. Every
day we saw inhabitants of the summer villages removing,
with much baggage, laden horses and dogs, to the winter
villages. Among other things they carried the strange dresses
belonging to the several bands, such as the buffalo heads of
the band, Berock-Ochata, and a live owl, which they keep as
a fortune-teller. Other Indians dragged dead dogs by a strap,
probably as a bait to catch wolves or foxes. We heard, in
the village, loud lamentations, and saw the women working
at the erection of a scaffold for a woman who had just died.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th of November, early in the morning, several
Indians arrived, who related, with much gravity, that in
the preceding night they had observed an extraordinary
number of falling stars, all moving in a westerly direction,
which they said was a sign of war, or of a great mortality,
and asked Mr. Kipp what he thought of it. Many other
Indians visited us, of whom several were in mourning, that
is, rubbed over with white clay, and all of them spoke of
the ominous phenomenon. They were much pleased with
Mr. Bodmer's Indian drawings, and asked us many questions
about their enemies, the Blackfeet. Among our most
constant visitors were the distinguished chief, Mato-Top&eacute;,
and Sih-Chida (the yellow feather). The former came with
his wife and a pretty little boy, to whom he had given the
name of Mato-Berocka (the male bear). He brought his
medicine drum, painted red and black,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which he hung up
in our room, and so afforded Mr. Bodmer an opportunity
of making a drawing of it. Sih-Chida, a tall, stout young
man, the son of a celebrated chief now dead, was an Indian
who might be depended on, who became one of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>best friends, and visited us almost daily. He was very
polished in his manners, and possessed more delicacy of
feeling than most of his countrymen. He never importuned
us by asking for anything; as soon as dinner was served he
withdrew, though he was not rich, and did not even possess
a horse. He came almost every evening, when his favourite
employment was drawing, for which he had some talent,
though his figures were no better than those drawn by our
little children. Ortubize, the interpreter, had moved, with
his family, to the post of Picotte, a trader among the Yanktonans,
where he was to pass the winter.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The people who
had been sent thither returned, on the 14th of November,
with the information that the Sioux were dispersed in the
prairie, and that they had made capital bargains with them
for beavers' skins. At our post we had to encounter the
mercantile opposition of Messrs. {415} Soublette and Campbell,
whereby the price of the buffalo skins was very much
raised.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> As our armed men now consisted of seventeen <i>engag&eacute;s</i>,
Mr. Kipp went to work and had my Mackinaw boat
drawn to land, and secured from the ice, a task which the
people had much difficulty in accomplishing. The 15th of
November was the first day we saw ice in the Missouri; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>sand banks were covered with a wide, thick sheet of ice
and the river was still open, no aquatic birds had been
seen for a long time; while, on the other hand, small flights
of <i>Fringilla linaria</i>, which travels southward in the winter
appeared in the prairie.</p>

<p>On the 16th November Mr. Kipp sent the men who had
come down with me back, on foot, to Fort Union. They
took with them two dogs, which drew well-laden <i>travails</i>
(sledges), and hoped to arrive there in about nine days. We
had a visit from the wolf chief, Charata-Numakshi, accompanied
by half-a-dozen Manitaries,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> among whom was a
tall, stout fellow, named Tichinga; his hair was tied in a
thick knot on his forehead; to this was attached a piece of
leather, so ornamented with fringes that his eyes were almost
concealed, and he could hardly see. At midday, I
saw the first flight of the snow bunting (<i>Emberiza nivalis</i>),
on the Missouri. They pass the winter here in the prairie
bushes, and live upon such seeds as they can pick up. Sih-Sa
(the red feather), the young Mandan Indian who, during
the day, takes charge of the horses belonging to the fort in
the prairie, came back to-day, having painted his whole body
with spots of white clay. I asked him why he had done
this? to which he replied, that he was thereby enabled to
run faster. We likewise received a visit from a Mandan
of half French extraction, named Kipsan-N&uuml;ka (the little
tortoise), whose father was a French Canadian. He affirmed
that he had formerly spoken both French and English, but
he had entirely forgotten both. Neither his features nor
his colour differed materially from the other Indians, whose
manners, customs, and dress he closely followed. Every
evening brought me a visit from Dipauch, who came to tell
me all the legends and traditions, as well as the religious
views of his people&mdash;conversations which interested me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>much, and which frequently lasted till late at night. Among
his auditors were several young people, who sat listening with
the most riveted attention to the disjointed sentences of our
narrator; while Mr. Kipp, with great patience, performed
the office of interpreter.</p>

<p>On the 17th of November we were visited by an old chief,
Ahda-Miga (the man without arms), who, however, has
no longer any influence among them. The bowl of his tobacco-pipe
was made of an old iron gun-barrel. Mr. Kipp
had many similar bowls made by the smith, which he sold
to the Indians for six dollars. Dipauch and his friend,
Berock-Itainu (the bull's neck), who was his inseparable
companion, were presented with bowls of this kind, made
in the form usual among the Indians. In the evening a
white wolf approached so closely to the fort, that he was
fired at from the gate, and attacked by our dogs.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of November we took possession of our new
apartment, which was now completed, except that the whitewashed
walls were still damp, and the constant wind generally
{416} filled it with smoke. We were, however, thankful
to have space to carry on our labours, to which we now
applied with great assiduity, to make up for the time we
had lost. The large windows afforded a good light for
drawing, and we had a couple of small tables and some
benches of poplar wood, and three shelves against the walls,
on which we spread our blankets and buffaloes' skins, and
reposed during the night. The room was floored; the door
was furnished with bolts on the inside, and the fire-wood,
covered with frozen snow, was piled up close to the chimney.
We all felt indisposed soon after we took up our abode in
this lodging, and were obliged to have recourse to medicine,
but this was, probably, to be ascribed principally to the way
of living and the state of the weather; for Sih-Sa and other
Indians had bowel complaints, catarrh, and violent coughs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
for which Mr. Kipp gave them medicines. I examined all
the medical stock of the fort, and found neither peppermint
nor other herbs, which would have been serviceable
at this time; only a handful of elder flowers, and rather
more of American camomile, which has a different taste
to the European. There were some common remedies,
but unfortunately we were without a medical man. Snow-storms,
with a high west wind, had set in, and on the 23rd
the country was covered with snow, and the Missouri froze
for the first time on that day, below the village of Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush,
and it is remarkable that it was frozen on the
very same day in the preceding year. We saw the Indian
women, as soon as the river was covered with ice, break
holes in it, to wash their heads and the upper part of their
bodies. The Indians had brought many beaver skins for
sale, of which Mr. Kipp purchased eleven large ones, in
exchange for a horse and some red cloth; the remainder,
for which they demanded another horse, they took back
with them. We had a visit from a young Mandan who had
a bag made of the skin of the prairie dog, containing some
pieces of a transparent selenite from which these Indians
extract a white colour by burning it in the fire. Mato-Top&eacute;
had passed the evening with us, and, when we went to bed,
laid himself down before the fire, where he soon fell asleep.
On the following morning he rose early, washed himself,
but left his two buffalo skins lying carelessly on the floor,
for us to gather them up, these Indians taking every opportunity
to be waited on by the Whites. As we were molested
during the night by numerous rats, we put my little tame
prairie fox into the loft above us, where some maize was
kept, and here he did excellent service. This pretty little
fox afforded us much amusement during the long winter
evenings. He was nearly a year old, but still liked to be
caressed and played all kinds of antics to attract notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Several wolves, which the Indians had brought to me,
were laid down near the fort, after they had been stripped
of their skins, but we did not succeed in alluring one of
their species by this bait. Dreidoppel, on his excursion,
had killed a couple of wolves, which he allured by imitating
the voice of a hare, and then shot with his fowling piece.
The hares had now put on their white winter coats, and
could scarcely be distinguished from the surrounding snow.
They {417} were seen sitting singly on the hills, and we
took them for buffaloes' skulls when there was no snow on
the prairie.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 25th of November we were alarmed
by information that some hostile Indians were near the
fort. Dipauch and Berock-Itainu, who were called the soldiers
of the fort, immediately took their arms, cautiously
opened the gate, and discovered a Manitari, who was concealed
near one of the block-houses, from which he was soon
driven rather roughly. At this time, Charbonneau came to
invite us to a great medicine feast among the Manitaries,
an invitation which I gladly accepted.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th we had fine weather and a
clear sky, very favourable for our expedition. At nine
o'clock, Bodmer, Charbonneau and myself set out, on foot,
with our double-barrelled guns and the requisite ammunition,
accompanied by a young Manitari warrior. We proceeded
up the Missouri in a direction parallel with the river,
leaving Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush on our right hand, and taking
the way to Ruhptare which runs along the edge of the high
Plateau, below which there is a valley extending to the Missouri,
covered with the maize plantations of the Mandans,
with some willow thickets and high reeds. On the left hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the prairie extended to the hills: it was covered with low,
withered, yellowish grass, and presented a barren, desolate
appearance. After proceeding about an hour, we came to
a stone, undoubtedly one of those isolated blocks of granite
which are scattered over the whole prairie, and which the
Indians, from some superstitious notion, paint with vermilion,
and surround with little sticks, or rods, to which were
attached some feathers. This stone, and many similar ones
in the prairie, are considered, by many Indians, as medicine;
but I was not able to learn what ideas they entertain
concerning the one here described. A little farther on, in a
small ravine which crosses the path, there was an elm, the
trunk of which was painted in many places with vermilion;
rags, stained with vermilion, were suspended from it, together
with a little bag containing some of the same colour,
as a sign that the tree was sacred or medicine. A covey of
prairie hens rose, with loud cries, from this ravine. At this
spot 1000 or 1200 Sioux had attacked the united Mandans
and Manitaries thirty years before, but lost 100 of their people.
One of those Indians was afraid to proceed on this
path, because he suspected that a wolf-pit, or trap, might
be in the way; but the partisan, or chief, wishing to shame
him, went before, and actually fell into such a pit, with
sharpened sticks at the bottom, by which he was killed.
From this place we came, in about half an hour, to the Mandan
village, Ruhptare, which is now totally abandoned.
The construction of the huts and medicines, the stages for
the dead, everything, in short, is just the same as at Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush,
only a much greater number of the stages
stood near the huts, and flocks of ravens sat upon them. To
the left of the village there is a little hill, which was quite
covered with these strange erections, and poles with offerings
suspended from them.</p>

<p>{418} We went through the village, in the centre of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
there is a circular space, with the representation of the ark of
the first man, and the figure of Ochkih-Hadda on a pole before
the medicine lodge. We soon came to the bank of the river,
and saw three Indians attempting to cross the ice of the
Missouri, which had scarcely been frozen over twenty-four
hours. Charbonneau went first, and we followed him on
the path marked out by some poles stuck in the ice. While
we were proceeding, carefully examining the ice with the
butt-end of our guns, we were overtaken by the old Mandan
chief, Kahka-Chamahan (the little raven), who wore a
round hat, with a plume of feathers, and who now led the
way.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> After we had passed the Missouri we met, on the
beach, some elegantly dressed Mandans, with whom we
did not stop to converse. We turned to the close willow
thicket which skirted an extensive forest on the north bank
of the river: the path led through it, in many windings,
till we reached the winter village, Ruhptare, which is closely
surrounded by a thicket of willow, poplar, ash, cornus, and
elm. Here the chief took leave of us, as we could not accept
his invitation to his hut. We saw the women everywhere
busy in tanning skins, and carrying wood. Most of the
high trees in the forest had been cut down; but there was a
shrub-like symphoria, with rounded elliptical leaves, and
small bunches of whitish-green berries, which, when quite
ripe, are of a bluish-black colour. This plant grows in great
abundance as underwood in all the forests in these parts.
Vitis, celastrus, and clematis, were entwined about some
of the trees, but the wild vine was nowhere thicker than a
little finger. There are many open spots in the wood, covered
with thin grass and other kinds of plants, and also reeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>We followed the winding path through this intricate wilderness,
to the hills, which bound the prairie, at the foot of
which we proceeded parallel to the Missouri: they are partly
clay hills, of angular forms, from which marshy springs issue
in many places, all which were at this time frozen over.
Several of these places were covered with extensive thickets
of reeds, and at the foot of the hills there were some bushes,
among which the Indians had set fox-traps, which they endeavour
to conceal with brushwood and buffaloes' skulls
laid on it. We here saw some Indians, and heard the report
of their guns. At the foot of the hills we saw the foot
steps of the Virginian deer, but we observed only a few birds,
chiefly crows, ravens, snow buntings, and the coal titmouse.
When we had gone about half an hour, the hills receded
from the river, and as soon as the wood terminates, the wide
prairie extends along the Missouri, where we lately visited,
on our arrival, Ita-Widahki-Hischa (the red shield). We
proceeded for several hours through the desolate plain,
which was covered with yellow, withered grass, now and
then broken by gentle eminences, where bleached buffaloes'
bones, especially skulls, are scattered about. We met with
a couple of Indians, heavily laden with skins, resting themselves,
who immediately asked us for tobacco. We had here
an opportunity of seeing the wolf pits, in which the Indians
fix sharp stakes, and the {419} whole is so covered with brushwood,
hay, and dry grass, that it cannot be perceived. As
our feet began to be very painful, we sat down to rest near
a stream, now almost dry, bordered with high grass, which
at this time was lying on the ground. As I was no longer
accustomed to such long journeys on foot, I had asked Mr.
Kipp for horses for this journey, but there were none in the
fort at that time. Our European boots and shoes had
wounded our feet, and it was with much pain that we ascended
the pretty steep hills which now again came nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to the river. I obtained from Charbonneau a pair of Indian
shoes, in which I found it easier to walk, but the thorns of
the cactus, which grew on the hills, pierced through them,
and caused me pain in another way.</p>

<p>Towards evening, when we descended from the hills to
the river, we again came to an extensive wood on the banks,
in which one of the winter villages of the Manitaries is
situated. We had, however, to walk several miles along a
very winding path before we reached it. Being extremely
tired, and our feet sore and wounded, it cost us some exertion
to get over fallen trunks of trees, sharp stones, &amp;c.,
in the way. The scenes which are inseparable from the
dwellings of the Indians soon appeared; slender young men,
galloping without saddle, who were driving their horses
home from the pasture; women cutting or carrying wood,
and the like. A young Indian joined us, who immediately
offered, out of civility, to carry my gun, which I did not
accept. He was an Arikkara, who had been captured, when
a child, by the Manitaries&mdash;a good-tempered, well-behaved
young man. He was tall and slender, with a pleasing countenance,
long, narrow eyes, and a slightly curved nose.</p>

<p>It was nearly nightfall when we reached the Manitari
village, the large huts of which were built so close to each
other that it was sometimes difficult to pass between them.
We heard loud lamentations as we approached, and learnt
that a child had just died, and that a corpse had been deposited,
a few days before, on poles placed in the boughs of a
tree. At the farther end of the village was the residence of
Mr. Dougherty<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a long, low, log-house, divided into three
apartments, of which that in the centre was used for a storehouse,
the northern apartment being assigned to the family,
and the southern to the <i>engag&eacute;s</i>. We were received with
much kindness, and, being thoroughly tired by a fatiguing
journey of, at least, nine leagues, we were truly glad to rest
our weary limbs before a blazing fire. A number of Manitari
Indians were assembled, who, however, gradually retired
whilst we took some refreshment, not having tasted
anything since we breakfasted at Fort Clarke. It being
reported that herds of buffaloes were at no great distance,
a party of Indians resolved to give them chase on the following
day, and to implore the blessing of heaven upon their
undertaking by a great medicine feast. Notwithstanding
the pain I suffered in walking, the prospect of witnessing so
novel a scene was so exciting that I immediately set out
about seven o'clock in the evening, accompanied by Dougherty
and Charbonneau, to see the Indian ceremony, which
was instituted by the women. Between the huts, in the
centre of the village, an elliptical {420} space, forty paces
or more in length, was enclosed in a fence, ten or twelve
feet high, consisting of reeds and willow twigs inclining inwards.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
An entrance was left at <i>a</i>; <i>b</i> represents the fence;
<i>d</i> are the four fires, burning in the medicine lodge, which
were kept up the whole time. At <i>e</i> the elder and principal
men had taken their seats; to the right sat the old chief,
Lachpitzi-Sihrisch (the yellow bear); some parts of his face
were painted red, and a bandage of yellow skin encircled
his head. Places were assigned to us on the right hand of
the yellow bear. At <i>f</i>, close to the fence, the spectators, especially
the women, were seated: the men walked about,
some of them handsomely dressed, others quite simply;
children were seated around the fires, which they kept alive
by throwing twigs of willow trees into them. Soon after
Charbonneau had introduced us to this company, six elderly
men advanced in a row from the opposite hut, and stopped
for a moment at the entrance of the great medicine lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>They had been chosen, by the young men, to represent
buffalo bulls, for which they afterwards received presents.
Each of them carried a long stick, at the top of which three
or four black feathers were fastened; then, at regular intervals,
the whole length of the stick was ornamented with
small bunches of the hoofs of buffalo calves, and at the
lower end of the stick were some bells. In their left hand
they carried a battle-axe, or war club, and two of them had
a stuffed skin which they called a badger, and used as a
drum. They stood at the entrance, rattled their sticks incessantly,
sang alternately, and imitated, with great perfection,
the hoarse voice of the buffalo bull. They were
followed by a tall man, whose physiognomy strikingly resembled
that of a Botocudo. He wore a cap, trimmed with
fur, because he had been formerly scalped in a battle. He
represented the director of the ceremony and the leader of
the old bulls, behind whom he made his appearance. The
bulls now entered the medicine lodge and took their seats
at <i>c</i>, near the fence, behind one of the fires. In front of them
they laid the badger, which is equivalent to what is called
the tortoise in the Okippe of the Mandans.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Each of the
bulls fixed his weapon in the ground before him; two of
them had clubs, with a head, on which a human face was
carved.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Several young men {421} were now employed in
carrying round dishes of boiled maize and beans, which they
placed before the guests. These dishes were handed to
each person successively, who passed them on after tasting
a small quantity. Empty wooden dishes were frequently
brought and placed at our feet, the reason of which I could
not, at first, comprehend, but soon learned from my neighbour,
the Yellow Bear. As soon as the provision bearer&mdash;a
tall, handsome, very robust, and broad-shouldered man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>wearing only his breechcloth, ornamented at the back with
long tufts of hair&mdash;came to take away one of these empty
dishes, the old chief held his hands before his face,
sang, and made a long speech, which seemed to me to be a
prayer uttered in a low tone of voice, and then gave him the
dish. These speeches contained good wishes for success
in hunting the buffalo, and in war. They invoke the
heavenly powers to favour the hunters and the warriors. In
this manner two dishes were sometimes placed before us,
and we also exerted ourselves in uttering good wishes
in the English and German languages, which the Indians
guessed from our motions, though they could not understand
our words. If the speech was lengthy, they were
specially gratified; the provision bearer stopped, listening
very attentively, nodded his satisfaction, and passed his
hand over our right arm from the shoulder to the wrist,
and sometimes over both arms, and then again spoke
a few words expressive of his thanks. In this manner
the ceremony of the repast lasted above an hour; every
person present partook of it, and offered up their good
wishes for a successful buffalo chase. Meantime, the
young men, in the centre of the space, prepared the
tobacco pipes, which they brought first to the old men and
the visitors; they presented the mouth-piece of the pipe to
us in succession, going from right to left: we each took a
few whiffs, uttered, as before, a wish or prayer, and passed
the pipe to our next neighbours. Among those who carried
the dishes and pipes, there was another young man who had
been scalped, and who also wore a cap; he had received
many wounds in the attack made by the Sioux on the Manitari
villages, and had been left on the field as dead. The
pipe bearers often turned their pipes towards the cardinal
points, and performed various superstitious man&#339;uvres with
them. The six buffalo bulls, meantime, sitting behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
fire, sang, and rattled the medicine sticks, while one of them
constantly beat the badger skin. After a while they all
stood up, bent forward, and danced; that is, they leaped as
high as they could with both their feet together, continuing
to sing and rattle their sticks, one of them beating time on
the badger. Their song was invariably the same, consisting
of loud, broken notes and exclamations. When they had
danced for some time, they resumed their seats.</p>

<p>The whole was extremely interesting. The great number
of red men, in a variety of costumes, the singing, dancing,
beating the drum, &amp;c., while the lofty trees of the forest,
illumined by the fires, spread their branches against the
dark sky, formed a <i>tout ensemble</i> so striking and original,
that I much regretted the impracticability of taking a sketch
of it on the spot. When the ceremony had continued a
couple of hours, the women began to act their part. A {422}
woman approached her husband, gave him her girdle and
under garment, so that she had nothing on under her robe;
she then went up to one of the most distinguished men,
passed her hand over his arm, from the shoulder downwards,
and then withdrew slowly from the lodge. The person so
summoned follows her to a solitary place in the forest; he
may then buy himself off by presents, which, however, few
Indians do. This honour was offered to us, but we returned
to the lodge, after having made a present, on which pipes
were again handed to us. The fires already burnt dim,
many Indians had retired, and we asked the old chief, whether
we might be permitted to do the same? At first he refused,
but, on our repeating the question, he gave us leave. On
other occasions, when circumstances allow all the inhabitants
of the village to unite, many additional ceremonies
take place; more dances are performed, and each of the
bands dances that which is peculiar to itself, which could
not be done to-day. The dance of the old buffalo bulls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with entire buffalo skulls, is said to be very interesting. This
festival always continues for four successive nights, and,
even on this occasion, the rioting and noise continued uninterruptedly
throughout the night.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the 27th of November, the
weather continued bright and clear. I observed in the thickets
near the dwelling of Dougherty, large numbers of the
little coal titmouse, but no other bird except the <i>Picus pubescens</i>.
A number of Indians congregated very early around
our fire, one of them having even ventured to take up his
night's quarters with us. The Yellow Bear and the man
who was scalped came early, the former to beg for some
coffee; he looked miserable and faint, as if he were in want
of food, and had a black silk handkerchief tied round his
head. The scene outside was very animated: we observed
many very handsome young men, in fine new dresses, some
of whom were playing the game called billiards, and on the
river, which was now quite frozen over, many children and
young people were amusing themselves with sliding and
other gambols. Some women were bringing wood from
the forest, others cutting holes in the ice to procure water,
and some playing with a leathern-ball, which they flung upon
the ice, caught it, and then threw it into the air, catching
it as it fell. At noon the thermometer was at 47&deg;, but a high
wind arose, and we were obliged to pass the whole day
under shelter of Mr. Dougherty's roof, where we witnessed
many very interesting scenes, the apartments being visited
by a succession of Indians throughout the day.</p>

<p>The following day was spent in the same manner. The
younger people, half naked, again played upon the ice, and
I paid a visit, accompanied by Charbonneau, to the Yellow
Bear. Mr. Dougherty had formerly resided in the hut which
he now inhabited, and for which he had to pay 80 or 100
dollars. The beds, consisting of square leathern cases, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
placed along the sides of this spacious hut, and the inmates
sat round the fire variously occupied. The Yellow Bear,
wearing only his breechcloth, sat upon a bench made of
willow boughs, covered with skin, and was painting a new
buffalo robe with figures in vermilion and black, having his
colours standing by {423} him, ready mixed, in old potsherds.
In lieu of a pencil he was using the more inartificial substitute
of a sharp pointed piece of wood. The robe was ornamented
with the symbols of valuable presents which he had
made, and which had gained the Yellow Bear much reputation,
and made him a man of distinction.</p>

<p>About twenty Manitaries had gone to hunt buffaloes, and
as we had no meat, we waited with no small degree of impatience
for their return. Our fast was of longer duration
than we liked, for it was late before a few of our hunters
arrived, and the scalped man brought us some meat, so
that we did not get our meal till evening. At nightfall, a
handsome young man came to us, accompanied by two girls,
it being the custom of the Indian youths to stroll about in
this manner. They had not been long in our room, when
somebody knocked at the door, on which the two girls crept
into Charbonneau's bed to hide themselves, as they suspected
it was some of their friends come to look after them;
but it proved to be only a messenger from Charbonneau,
who, wishing to procure us a pleasant diversion for the
evening, let us know that the women in a certain hut were
about to perform a medicine dance; and, availing ourselves
of the intimation, we hastened to the spot without loss of
time.</p>

<p>On the left hand of the wooden screen at the door of the
hut a fire was burning, and before it were spread out skins
upon some hay, on which five or six men were seated in a
row, one of whom beat the drum, and the other rattled the
schischiku&eacute;. They were more than usually vehement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the performance of this music; the drummer especially exerted
himself to the utmost, and all the rest accompanied
him with singing. Some elderly women were seated near
the wall; a tall, robust woman, however, especially attracted
our attention; she was standing in the centre of the hut;
her dress consisted of a long yellow leather robe, trimmed
with a quantity of fringes, and ornamented with pieces of
red and blue cloth. We took our places to the right of the
musicians, just in front of a number of spectators, consisting
of women and children, who were prevented from pressing
forward by a young man, who made use of the official dignity
of a stick, with which he was invested for the occasion. The
woman standing in the centre pretended that she had a head
of maize in her stomach, which she would conjure up, and
again cause to disappear. We had come rather too late,
for the ear of maize had already disappeared; but Charbonneau
spoke to the people, to whom we gave ten carrots
of tobacco, and the trick was repeated. Our tobacco was
thrown on a heap of roasted buffalo ribs, which were piled
up on willow boughs, and there it remained till the end
of the ceremony, the object of which was to procure a good
crop of maize in the succeeding year. The din of the music
now recommenced with renewed vehemence, and four women
began to move. They waddled like ducks, making
short steps, with their feet turned inwards, and keeping time
to the quick beat of the drum; while their arms hung down
motionless by their sides. The medicine woman danced
alone near the fire, to which she {424} sometimes put her
hands, and then laid them upon her face. At length she
began to totter, to move her arms backwards and forwards,
and to use convulsive motions, which became more and
more violent. Now, as she threw her head backwards, we
saw the top of a white head of maize fill her mouth, and
gradually came more forward, while her contortions greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
increased. When the head of maize was half out of her
mouth, the dancer seemed ready to sink down, when another
woman advanced, laid hold of her and seated her on the
ground. Here, supported by her companion, she fell into
convulsions, and the music became overpoweringly violent.
Other women brushed the arm and breast of the performers
with bunches of wormwood, and the head of maize gradually
disappeared; on which the juggleress rose, danced twice
round the hut, and was succeeded by another female. After
this second woman had danced in the same manner, a stream
of blood suddenly rushed from her mouth over her chin,
which, however, she extracted from a piece of leather that
she held in her mouth. She, too, was cured of her convulsions
as she lay on the ground, and then danced around the
fire. Other women came forward and danced behind one
another, which concluded the ceremony.</p>

<p>Almost all these people pretended that they had some
animal in their stomach; some a buffalo calf, others a deer,
&amp;c. The scalped man told us that he had a buffalo calf
in his left shoulder, and often felt it kick. Another, who
pretended that he had three live lizards in his inside, complained
to Charbonneau that these animals gave him pain,
on which Charbonneau gave him a cup of coffee, but as this
remedy did not relieve him, a cup of tea was given him, and
this produced the desired effect. Notions of this kind are so
common among the Indians, and they are said to have so
firm a hold on the faith of the people, that it would be
labour lost to attempt to convince them of their folly.</p>

<p>On the 29th of November, during which we continued
in the Manitari village, the whole forest was covered with
hoar frost; all the woods on the banks were clothed in
white, and the red youths were sporting on the ice; the
whole forming an interesting and animated scene. Mr.
Bodmer painted several animals and birds for the Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
such as cocks, eagles &amp;c., which they pretended would
make them proof against musket balls. In the evening
Mr. Bodmer and Dougherty again went to the medicine
feast, but the women did not, on this occasion, make their
appearance, for which nobody, not even Charbonneau,
who was so well acquainted with the Indians, could assign
any reason. After dark our house-door was twice forced
open, and we again observed how much more rude and
savage the Manitaries are than the Mandans. Dougherty,
who did not yet possess a fort, and was obliged to live
among the former, suffered greatly from their importunity
and rudeness; he was afraid even to give them a refusal, lest
he might thereby bring upon himself greater inconveniences,
for a continued and close intercourse with these people is
always attended with danger. We had not been able to
borrow horses to {425} return to Fort Clarke; but, on the
30th, Mr. Dougherty succeeded in obtaining one, and
Durand, a clerk of Messrs. Soublette and Campbell, who
had arrived on horseback, returned with us, and allowed
Mr. Bodmer to ride with him.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock we took leave of our kind hosts, Dougherty
and Charbonneau, and set out on our return. In the
forest-village belonging to the inhabitants of Ruhptare, we
stopped at a hut, in which Garreau, an old trader of Messrs.
Soublette and Campbell, resided.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> There was an abundance
of meat hanging up in this hut, as they had had a
very successful buffalo hunt. From this place I sent back
my horse; but Durand, though with great difficulty, got his
across the frozen river; the poor beast was nearly exhausted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>it often slipped, and sometimes fell down. At twilight we
reached Fort Clarke, where, during our absence, good news
had been received of the cessation of the cholera in St.
Louis and the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>During November the weather had, on the whole, been
tolerably pleasant: a few days were stormy, with some snow
and slight frost; and this kind of weather continued at the
beginning of December. A high stage of strong posts was
erected in our court-yard, where a part of the stock of maize
was deposited, thereby to protect it from the voracity of the
rats. It was defended from the rain by the leather covering
of Indian tents.</p>

<p>The Mandan village near the fort was now entirely forsaken
by the inhabitants. The entrances to the huts were
blocked with bundles of thorns; a couple of families only
still remained, one of which was that of Dipauch, whom
Mr. Bodmer visited every day, in order to make a drawing
of the interior of the hut.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Instead of the numerous inhabitants,
magpies were flying about, and flocks of snow buntings
were seen in the neighbourhood about the dry plants
of the prairie, where the Indian children set long rows of
snares, made of horsehair, to catch them alive.</p>

<p>Belhumeur had been sent several times to the prairie,
and had brought back buffaloes' flesh; but the animals were
so far off that we could not always be supplied, and were
forced to live on hard dried meat and boiled maize; our
beverage consisted of coffee and the water of the Missouri.
Dreidoppel had killed several wolves, prairie dogs, and
prairie hens; the Indians had brought me some white hares
and other smaller animals. One of our dogs was shot in the
foot by an Indian, with an arrow. Neither the motive nor
the perpetrator of this hostile act could be discovered.</p>

<p>Having been invited by the Indians to the winter village,
to be present at a great medicine feast, we proceeded thither,
on the 3rd of December, in the afternoon. Mr. Kipp took
his family with him, and Mato-Top&eacute; and several other Indians
accompanied us. We were all well armed, because
it was asserted that a band of hostile Indians had been seen
among the prairie hills on the preceding day. Our beds,
blankets, and buffalo skins were laid on a horse, on which
Mr. Kipp's wife, a Mandan Indian, rode. Thus we passed,
at a rapid pace, through the prairie, along the Missouri, then
below the hills, which are pretty high; and I cannot deny
that, in the valleys and {426} ravines, through which some
small streams that we had to pass flowed, our whole company
looked anxiously to the right and left to see whether
any enemies would issue from their ambush. We had to
pass a narrow gorge behind a little thick copse, where many
Indians had been killed by their enemies. After proceeding
about an hour and a half we reached the village in the wood,
which is the winter residence of the inhabitants of Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush.
We stopped at the hut of Mr. Kipp's father-in-law,
Mandeek-Suck-Choppenik (the medicine bird), who
accommodated us with a night's lodging. The description
of this hut may serve for all the winter huts of these Indians.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
It was about twenty paces in diameter, and circular: <i>h</i> is
the fence or wall of the hut, supported inside by strong, low
posts, on which rests the vaulted roof, which has a square
hole to let the smoke escape; <i>g</i> is the entrance, protected
by two projecting walls covered above. At <i>f</i> is the door,
consisting of a piece of leather stretched on a frame. At
<i>d d</i> there is a cross wall of considerable height, made of reeds
and osier twigs woven together, to keep off the draught of
air. At <i>e e e</i> there is another cross wall, only three feet high,
behind which the horses stand; <i>a</i> is the fireplace, round
which, at <i>c c c c</i>, are the seats of the inmates, consisting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>benches formed of basket-work, covered with skins; <i>b b b b</i>
are four strong pillars which bear the roof, and are very
well united above by cross beams. At <i>i</i> there was a large
leather case for the beds in which the family slept. A chain,
with a large kettle, was suspended from the roof over the
fire, to cook our supper, consisting of very pleasant flavoured
sweet maize. The master of the hut was absent, but his
wife, daughter, and son-in-law, received us very kindly.
We had still a little time before the commencement of the
medicine feast, which consisted of the dance of the half-shorn
head, which the soldiers sold to the raven band. This
feast was to last forty nights, and the son-in-law of our host
was among the sellers. We sat around the fire and smoked,
while the drum was beat in the village to call the two parties
together. After seven o'clock we repaired to the medicine
lodge; it was entirely cleared, except that some women
sat along the walls; the fire burned in the centre, before
which we took our seats, near the partition <i>d d</i>, with several
distinguished men of the band of the soldiers. At our left
hand, the other soldiers, about twenty-five in number, were
seated in a row; some of them were handsomely dressed,
though the majority {427} were in plain clothes. They had
their arms in their hands, and in the centre were three men,
who beat the drum. On the right side of the fire stood the
young men of the raven band, who were the purchasers;
they were obliged to satisfy the soldiers, who were the sellers,
by making them valuable presents, such as horses, guns,
powder and ball, blankets of different colours, kettles, &amp;c.;
to continue the feast forty nights; to regale them, for that
time, with provisions and tobacco, and offer their wives to
them every evening. The soldiers had consented to these
terms, and the festival took place every evening in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>We had all taken our seats before the band of the sellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
arrived; but we soon heard them singing, accompanied by
the drum, and they entered with their insignia; these consisted
of four poles, or lances, seven or eight feet long, the
iron points of which resembled sword blades, and were held
downwards; the rest of the instrument was wrapped round
with broad bands of otter-skin, like that of the Blackfeet,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and decorated at the point and other places with strips of
skin: two of these poles are curved at the top. The others
were a club with an iron point, painted red and ornamented
with feathers; then three lances, decorated alternately with
black and white feathers;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and, lastly, a very beautifully
ornamented bow and quiver. These nine insignia were
brought in, the soldiers, however, stopping, at first, near
the door behind the cross wall. When they had remained
for some time in this position, singing and beating the drum
with great violence, they entered, placed the lances against
the wall, and fixed the club in the ground near one of the
pillars that supported the hut; after which they all took
their seats near the wall. While the singing and dancing
were continued alternately for some time, the purchasers
filled their pipes and presented them to all of us in succession.
We took one or two whiffs; they did the same, and
carried the pipe round to the left hand, but offered it only
to the visitors and to the sellers. This smoking continued
a long time, during which each of the guests received a
small cake of sweet corn baked in fat. In about half an
hour two of the soldiers rose and danced opposite each
other. One of them was a tall, powerful man, with a weak,
effeminate voice. He wore nothing but his robe and leggins,
but without any ornaments; he took the club and held
it firmly in his left hand; his right hand hung straight down;
he bent his body forwards and danced, that is, he leaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>with his feet close together, keeping time with the music.
The head and legs of the other dancer were very handsomely
ornamented, but the breast and shoulders were bare. He
took one of the first four lances, which he held in both hands,
and the two men then danced, or leaped, opposite each other.
In a few minutes the first dancer put the lance aside and
sat down, while all the other members of this band uttered
the war-whoop, accompanied by the quick beating of the
drum, now and then shouting aloud. Silence then ensued;
the man with the club addressed the purchasers, called them
his sons, and enumerated some of his exploits; after which
he presented to them the war club. One of the purchasers
called him his father, passed his hand along his arm, took
{428} the weapon from his hand, and put it in its place again.
The other dancer again came forward, did the same, spoke
of his exploits, and presented the lance to a man or son of
the other band, who received it with the same ceremony,
and put it also in its place again. There were singing and
dancing in the intervals, but no schischiku&eacute; was heard. Two
other soldiers then rose, related their deeds, how they had
stolen horses, taken a medicine from the enemy, and the
like, and presented two of the insignia to the purchasers.
When this had been done four or five times, the women of
the raven band rose; four of them threw aside their robes,
snatched up the lances, carried them successively out of the
hut, and, some time after, brought them in again. They
hastened to pass by us, and some of them appeared to feel
ashamed. This ceremony was repeated twice: these
women then came, passed their hands down the arms of the
strangers and of the fathers, took up their robes and went
out, in the same manner as has been related in the medicine
feast of the Manitaries. When they returned the second
time, Mr. Kipp rose to go away, and I followed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Some of the women were fat and corpulent, others very
young, and one but little past childhood.</p>

<p>This feast was continued in the same manner forty
nights. During the purchase of the dance of the half-shorn
head, the buffalo medicine feast, which continues four
nights, was celebrated in another hut. We retired to the
hut of the Medicine Bird, smoked our cigars, and lay down
in our clothes to sleep on buffalo skins spread on the floor.
The weather was frosty, and it was very cold even in the
hut; the Indians set a watch, during the night, that they
might not be surprised by their enemies.</p>

<p>On the 4th of December, early in the morning, we left
the village; we did not keep along the hills, but took another
path through the thickets, which led in some places
over frozen marshes, which were partly covered with reeds.
The wood, which was spangled with hoar frost, is very
much cleared, and contains but few large trees. A high,
cold southeast wind blew in the prairie, and afterwards
became violent. At eight o'clock we reached the fort, where
we much enjoyed a hot breakfast. Several Mandans came
to see us, among whom was the strongest man of this nation,
named Beracha-Iruckcha (the broken pot), whom no
one had yet been able to overcome in wrestling, though
he had been matched with white men, negroes, and Indians,
remarkable for their strength. Sih-Chida and Maksick-Karehde
(the flying eagle), also visited us; the latter
was the tallest man among the Mandans, and belonged to
the band of the soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Snow had already set in, yet still the buffaloes did not
come nearer, and we were in want of fresh meat, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
tallow to make candles; and all the meat we could get was
obtained from individual Indians returning from the chase.
In the environs of the fort there were, at this time, wolves,
foxes, and a few hares, and during the night we heard the
barking of the prairie wolves (<i>Canis latrans</i>, Say), which
prowled about, looking for any remnants of provisions. In
our excursions {429} we everywhere met with wolves, foxes,
hares, weasels, and mice, especially on the banks of the
streams, and set snares of iron wire, in order to learn what
species of mice could bear this winter weather. Our snares
were often carried away by the wolves and foxes, but we
frequently caught the <i>Mus leucopus</i>, which is especially the
prey of the weasel. If any one imitate the voice of the hare,
in order to attract the wolves, a number of magpies immediately
come and settle in the neighbourhood. Scarcely
any kinds of birds were found in the forest but <i>Pica hudsonica</i>,
<i>Picus pubescens</i>, <i>Parus atracapillus</i>, <i>Fringilla linaria</i>,
and <i>Tetrao phasianellus</i>, of which several were shot.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December, Charbonneau returned to the
service of the American Fur Company, and took up his
quarters in the fort, which gave me an opportunity to have
much conversation with him respecting the Manitaries, with
whom he was well acquainted. On the 11th, Dreidoppel,
with his rifle, shot a prairie wolf (<i>Canis latrans</i>) on the ice
of the Missouri, which crept into a burrow, where he could
not get at it. He was returning to the fort, when a couple
of Indians called after him, who had dragged the animal
alive from its retreat, and brought it to our lodging, when
Mr. Bodmer made a sketch of the head.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> On the 13th
of December, when Fahrenheit's thermometer was at 17&deg;,
several birds of the species <i>Bombycilla garrula</i> were brought
to us: they are found in these parts during the summer also,
and are said to breed here, which I think is doubtful. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>obtained many wolves from the quite white to the perfectly
grey, common variety, which the Indians sold for two rolls
of tobacco a-piece. They also often caught ermines in horsehair
snares, which they sell dear. As we continued to be
in want of fresh meat and tallow, we had to send people
for these necessaries to the Indian villages, and Mr. Kipp
likewise went thither in his sledge, in order to trade. On
one occasion his horse broke through the ice, so that it remained
for an hour in the water, and was quite benumbed.
An extremely cold storm from the north had blown away
the wooden screen from our chimney. On the 15th of December,
and on the preceding evening, we had a heavy fall
of snow, which ceased when the wind veered a little to the
north. At eight o'clock the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer
was at 14&deg;. The appearance of the prairie at this
time was very remarkable, resembling the sea agitated by
a terrible storm. The extensive surface of the snow was
carried by the wind in a cloud; it was scarcely possible for
the eye to bear the cold blast which drove the snow before
it, and enveloped us in a dense cloud, above which the sky
was clear, and the tops of the prairie hills were visible.
We were, therefore, the more sensible of the enjoyment of
our bright fire, seated about which we passed our time agreeably
in various occupations. About this time the enemy
had stolen six horses from the Manitaries. We had been
for some time without meat, when the Indians, hunting at
a considerable distance, at the forks of Teton River,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> killed
fifty-five buffaloes. On this occasion, Mr. Kipp's horse
was lost, which, bridled and saddled as it was, had joined
a herd of buffaloes; and two foals had perished in the cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>{430} On the 16th the mercury was at 2&deg;, Fahrenheit, below
zero. For some time past the water in our room was frozen
every day, notwithstanding the large fire which we kept up.
Towards the 19th of December, the weather was again fine;
in a few days there was snow, and the Missouri rose so high
that it partly overflowed the ice that covered it. Some of
Mr. Soublette's people arrived from St. Louis, which they
had left on the 14th of October, and confirmed the accounts
which we had already received of the cessation of the cholera.
They told us that, in October, the snow was fifteen inches
deep on the banks of the Konzas River, and that the party
escorting the caravan from Santa F&eacute; had been so closely
hemmed in by the Indians (probably Arikkaras), that they
had been compelled, by want of provisions, to slaughter
fourteen of their horses.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd of December, a number of white maggots
were found under a piece of poplar bark, which were completely
enclosed in ice, but all came to life when they were
warmed at the fire. On the 23rd, the mercury was at 10&deg;
Fahrenheit, above zero; the sky was bright and clear, the
wind blew from the east, the icy covering of the river smoked
and the woods were covered with hoar frost. The ravens
came near to the fort to pick up food; the wolves, in consequence
of our frequent excursions, had retired to a greater
distance.</p>

<p>On this day, at noon, we heard the drums of the Indians,
and a crowd of their people filled the fort. At their head
were fourteen men of the band of the bulls, from Ruhptare,
distinguished by their strange costume.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>{431} The whole head was covered with a wig, consisting
of long plaits of hair, which hung down on every side, so
that even the face was completely concealed. The appearance
of these men was very singular in the cold weather, for
their breath issued from between the plaits of hair like a
dense vapour. They wore in their heads feathers of owls,
ravens, and birds of prey, each of which had at the tip a
large white down feather. One of them had a very handsome
fan of white feathers on his head, doubtless the entire
tail of a swan, each of the feathers having at the tip a tuft
of dyed horsehair. They were closely enveloped in their
robes, and had bow-lances ornamented with feathers, coloured
cloth, beads, &amp;c., and most of them had foxes' tails
at their heels. Some of these men beat the drum, while
they all formed a circle, and imitated the bellowing of the
buffalo bulls. After they had danced awhile, some tobacco
was thrown to them, and they proceeded to the village in
the forest further down the river, taking off their wigs. The
frozen Missouri was covered with Indians on this occasion,
and presented an interesting scene. At this time the Sioux
stole from the prairie thirty-seven horses belonging to the
Mandans. On this day Dreidoppel had dragged the entrails
of a hare about the prairie, and then concealed himself;
he soon saw six wolves follow the scent and approach him;
but it was so cold that he could not wait for them. Our
cook, a negro, had a violent dispute with an Indian from
Ruhptare, who had taken a piece of meat out of his pot,
and the affair might have led to unpleasant consequences.
The Indians of that village are the worst of the Mandans.
Several articles had been stolen, which was nothing uncommon
among our worthy neighbours, for even the wife of
Mato-Top&eacute; had pilfered something in our room.</p>

<p>On the 24th of December, and on the preceding night, there
was a very strong cold wind from the northwest (Fahren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>heit's
thermometer +12&frac12;&deg;), which blew all the hoar frost
from the trees. Many Indians knocked violently at our
door, and attempted to force it, as we did not open it immediately.
About four o'clock Papin and three other <i>engag&eacute;s</i>,
with seven horses, arrived from Picotte's post among the
Yanktonans, which they had left two days before, and
told us that they had there found 200 tents of the Yanktonans.
At midnight the <i>engag&eacute;s</i> of the fort fired a volley
to welcome Christmas day, which was repeated in the morning:
the 25th of December was a day of bustle in the fort.
Mr. Kipp had given the <i>engag&eacute;s</i> an allowance of better provisions,
and they were extremely noisy in their Canadian
jargon. The poor fellows had had no meat for some time,
and had lived on maize, boiled in water, without any fat.
Pehriska-Ruhpa, a robust Manitari, who had long lived
among the Mandans, visited us, and soon afterwards Mato-Top&eacute;,
but they took no notice of each other, as they were
not on good terms, and the former immediately withdrew.
He promised to have his portrait taken in his handsome
dress.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>At noon there was a concourse of Indians in the fort: the
woman's band of the white buffalo cow came to perform
their dance.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The company consisted of seventeen, mostly
old women, {432} and two men, with the drum and schischiku&eacute;;
the first of these two men carried a gun in his hand.
A stout elderly woman went first; she was wrapped in the
hide of a white buffalo cow, and held, in her right arm, a
bundle of twigs in the form of a cornucopia, with down
feathers at the top, and at the lower end an eagle's wing,
and a tin drinking vessel. Another woman carried a similar
bundle. All these women wore round their heads a
piece of buffalo's skin in the form of a hussar's cap, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>plume of owl's or raven's feathers in front, some of which
were dyed red; only two of them wore the skin of a polecat;
all the men were bare-headed. The women were uniformly
painted; the left cheek and eye were vermilion, and they
had two blue spots on the temple near the right eye.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> All
except the first wore painted robes, and two of them only
had the hairy side outwards. When they had formed a
circle the music began in quick time; the men sung, and
the women who were dancing responded in a loud shrill
voice. In their dances they rock from side to side, always
remaining on the same spot. After they had been dancing
for some time there was a pause, when the dance recommenced.
Only the oldest of these women, most of whom
were exceedingly plain, had the tattooed stripes on the chin
which are peculiar to this band.</p>

<p>They had scarcely left us, after receiving a present, when
three <i>engag&eacute;s</i> arrived with letters from Fort Union. They
informed us that Mr. Mc Kenzie had built a new fort at
the mouth of the Rivi&egrave;re aux Trembles, which he had called
Fort Jackson, and appointed Mr. Chardon director.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Up
to the 15th, when these messengers left Fort Union, the
weather had been very mild; the river was quite free from
ice, and no snow had fallen. Mr. Mc Kenzie invited me
to visit him at Fort Union, but the inclemency of the weather
rendered such a journey extremely unpleasant. The wind
had blown down all the pickets at Fort Union, and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Indians, probably Gros Ventres des Prairies, had shot a
white man on the Yellow Stone. Information had been
brought by some Indians that Doucette, when on a journey
from Fort Mc Kenzie to the Kutanas, had been shot by the
Blood Indians.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>On the 26th of December the wind blew the snow into
the air and obscured the sky. With a temperature of 12&deg;,
Fahrenheit, early in the morning we observed a rainbow
among the clouds of snow, with a parhelion in the centre.
We dispatched a number of letters, which were forwarded
on the 27th by <i>engag&eacute;s</i>, from station to station, down the
river. Four men, with two sledges, and a number of horses,
were sent from the fort, two of whom were to receive a supply
of fresh meat for use at the trading post of the Yanktonans,
from which they were expected to return in four
days. Sih-Chida brought us the paper which his father,
at that time the first chief of the Mandans, had received
from General Atkinson and Major O'Fallon, several years
before, when a treaty of friendship and commerce was concluded
with the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This document was written on
large paper in the English and Manitari languages. Most
of the Indian names, which were doubtless given by Charbonneau,
were incorrectly written. As we had now {433} no
meat, our breakfast consisted of coffee and maize bread,
and our dinner of maize bread and bean soup. Our people
caught an Indian dog in the fort, intending to put him in
a sledge, but he was so wild and unruly, bit and howled so
furiously, that it was long before they could obtain the mastery.
An <i>engag&eacute;</i> then knelt upon him to put on the harness,
but when this was done he discovered that he had killed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>poor dog. These dogs, if they are not broken in, are quite
unfit for the sledge; when, however, they are accustomed
to the work, they draw a sledge over the snow more easily
than the best horse. If the snow is frozen, they run over
it, where the horse sinks in, and they can hold out much
longer. They can perform a journey of thirty miles in one
day; and if they have rested an hour on the snow, and had
some food, they are ready to set out again. A horse must
have sufficient food, frequent rest, and a good watering
place, and when it is once tired it cannot be induced to proceed.
I have been assured by some persons that they had
made long journeys, for eight successive days, with dogs,
during which time the animals did not taste any food. In
the winter, when the Indians go to hunt the buffalo, they
drive, in light sledges, over the frozen snow, into the midst
of the herd; the Indian, with his bow and arrows, sits or
kneels down in the sledge; and dogs that have been
trained, cannot be held back when they perceive the buffalo
herd. In the north three good dogs are seldom to be purchased
for less than 100 dollars. A single dog, when it is
very good and strong, costs sixty or seventy dollars; on the
Missouri, however, they are by no means so dear.</p>

<p>On the 28th December, about noon, we again heard the
Indian drums: several soldiers announced the band which
had lately purchased the dance of the half-shorn head. The
whole company, very gaily and handsomely dressed, soon
afterwards entered the fort, followed by a crowd of spectators.
About twenty vigorous young men, with the upper
part of the body naked (having thrown off their robes which
they wore at their entrance), painted and ornamented in
the most gaudy manner, formed a circle in the court-yard
of the fort. Their long plaits of hair were covered with
reddish clay. One eagle's feather, or several other feathers,
were fixed transversely in the hair; others had a long plait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
hanging down, with five or six brass rosettes, in the manner
of the Sioux; several had a bunch of owl's feathers hanging
down, necklaces of bears' claws and otters' tails, wolves'
tails at their heels, red cloth or leather leggins, often painted,
or with bells fixed to them; they had a looking-glass suspended
from the wrist, or the waist, and carried the several
insignia of the dance, such as the long hooked sticks, or
rods, adorned with otter's skin and feathers, the straight rod,
covered with red cloth<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> &amp;c., and had guns or bow-lances
in their hands. One of them wore a long feather cap, with
horns and strips of ermine on his head; another sat on horseback,
and was daubed with yellow clay, and bleeding wounds
were painted on his body: he carried a bow and arrows,
without a quiver; his leggins were of red cloth, trimmed
with a row of bells. His horse was likewise painted, {434}
and the bridle ornamented with red and black cloth. The
three musicians belonged to the band of the soldiers. They
were dressed in shabby blanket robes. As soon as the drum
was beat, the dancers bent their bodies forward, leaped up
with both feet together, holding their guns in their hands,
and the finger on the trigger, as if going to fire. In this
manner they danced for about a minute in a circle, then
gave a loud shout, and, having rested a little, began the
dance again, and so on alternately. Some tobacco was
thrown on the ground before them, after which they soon
broke up, took up their robes and went to Ruhptare, where
they danced and passed the night, and then exhibited their
performances among the Manitaries.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kipp had received orders from Mr. Mc Kenzie to go
to Fort Union, and he accordingly made the necessary preparations
for this winter's journey. He purchased, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>the Indians, eighteen dogs; and the getting sledges in readiness
caused some bustle in the fort.</p>

<p>On the 29th of December, the thermometer, at eight o'clock
in the morning, was at 19&deg; Fahrenheit, and the high northwest
wind was so cutting that we could not hold it out long
in the prairie. Notwithstanding this, the dogs were collected,
and harnessed with considerable difficulty, as they
made much resistance. Mr. Kipp travelled with five Indian
sledges, with a sufficient number of well-armed <i>engag&eacute;s</i>.
Charbonneau accompanied him on what is called a cariole
(a convenient wooden sledge, drawn by one horse), in order
to purchase meat for us of the Indians. The appearance
of the caravan was very amusing, for many of the dogs, not
trained to this service, jumped from one side to the other
and could not be brought into order but by the use of the
whip. The three dogs which drew the principal sledge had,
on their collars, a large double bow, covered and ornamented
with red, yellow, blue, and white fringe, to which a bell was
suspended.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>About noon the snow storm increased, and it was
so cold in our apartment that, notwithstanding a good
fire, we were unable to work. The high wind drove
the snow through the crevices in the walls and the doors,
and the whole place was filled with smoke. The thermometer
at noon was 14&deg; Fahrenheit. The night, too, was stormy,
and on the 30th the hurricane from {435} the west roared
exactly as at sea; a great deal of snow lay in our room, and
the water was frozen. In the prairie we could not keep our
eyes open on account of the excessive glare: exposure to
the weather was painful both to man and beast. It was
hoped, however, that it would soon cause the herds of
buffaloes to come nearer to us; but this expectation was not
realized though it was said that there were many at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
post of the Yanktonans. Our horses were obliged, during
this dreadful weather, to walk about the whole night in the
court-yard of the fort, with a mass of ice and snow on their
backs. As Gautier, an old <i>engag&eacute;</i>, was bringing wood into
the room, and the door remained open a short time, Mr.
Bodmer's colours and pencils froze, so that he could not
use them without hot water. Writing, too, was very difficult,
because our ink was congealed; and, while the side
of our bodies which was turned to the fire was half roasted,
the other was quite benumbed, and we were often forced to
rise in order to warm ourselves. The cook had his ears
frostbitten in going to the river to fetch water.</p>

<p>To add to our chapter of misfortunes, news was received
that the Yanktonans had stolen some horses from the Mandans,
and killed several. This was the fourth time that
these Indians had broken the peace concluded in the preceding
September, and the Mandans were so incensed at
their treachery that they were disposed to recommence the
war.</p>

<p>This day Mr. Kipp got no further on his journey than
the Manitari village, because some of his dogs had broken
loose and run away, and several of his people had their
faces frostbitten. The last day of the year was clear and
cold: at eight o'clock in the morning the mercury was at
16&frac12;&deg;, by Reaumur's thermometer, below freezing point: a
vapour rose from the river. Towards noon the wind again
blew high, the frozen snow crackled, and no animals, not
even wolves or ravens, were to be seen. Before this weather
set in, the Indians had ridden fifteen miles into the prairie,
where many of them were almost frozen to death, but were
recovered by being wrapped up in blankets, and laid before
the fire.</p>

and entered the Columbia Fur Company. Afterwards (1827-30) he was a member
of the French Fur Company; and when that was merged in the American
Company he became a partner in the Upper Missouri Outfit. He had much influence
with the Sioux, among whom he married, and for many years was stationed
at Fort Pierre (see our volume xxii, p. 315, note 277). Audubon met him at this
post in 1843; and in later years he had charge of the annual voyage of the trading
steamer to the upper river. In 1846 Father De Smet was his guest at Fort Pierre.
About two years later Picotte retired from the active business of the company,
and removed to St. Louis. In the early days of the trade, he had a brother associated
with him; and his half-breed son, Charles F. Picotte, was a noted figure
in early Dakota history. See South Dakota Department of History <i>Collections</i>,

a post fifty feet square, naming it in honor of the president of the United States.

<p>January set in with increasing cold, which at eight in the
morning was 18&deg; Reaumur, and on the 2nd, at the same
hour, 25&deg;, Reaumur, below freezing point. On the 3rd the
mercury sank into the ball, and was frozen; it remained
there on the 4th, but on the 5th it rose, and at eight in the
morning was 9&deg; below zero. During these cold days, some
of our woodcutters had their noses and cheeks frostbitten.
The horizon was hazy; the river smoked; neither man nor
animal was to be seen; yet a party of Mandans, with their
wives, were in the prairie hunting buffaloes, of which they
killed forty. At night the cold was so intense, that we could
not venture to put our hands from our bodies, lest they
should be frozen. In the morning we could scarcely endure
the severity of the weather, till we had a blazing fire, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
bleak northwest wind penetrated through all the seams of
the building. We received information that Mr. Kipp had
remained with the Manitaries till the 2nd of January, and
had not proceeded on his journey till the cold had somewhat
abated. Almost all his people had some part of their
body frostbitten, and eight of his {437} dogs had run away.
Some Indians who visited us presented rather a novel appearance,
having their hair, and even their eyelashes, covered
with hoar frost and icicles. In our own room, the boots
and shoes were frozen so hard in the morning, that we could
scarcely put them on; ink, colours, and pencils were perfectly
useless. During this cold we were visited by a deaf
and dumb Mandan, who had no covering on the upper part
of his body under his robe. On the 3rd of January, at noon,
when the sunbeams, shining on the frozen snow, were extremely
dazzling, the thermometer being at 24&deg; below zero,
I saw no living creatures in the neighbourhood of the Indian
village, except flocks of the snow-bunting, and a few
ravens, two species of birds which are capable of enduring
the severest cold. The Yanktonans, and the people whom
we had sent to Picotte, returned, on the 4th of January,
with dried meat, as well as tallow for candles: they said
that, during the two coldest days, they had halted in the
forest, but that, in the night, the wolves had carried off part
of their meat. On the 5th of January the air was misty,
and at one o'clock there were two parhelia at a considerable
distance from the sun; they were, however, faint and rather
irregular. It was scarcely possible to obtain water from
the river, and the water-casks in our room were frozen to
the bottom. Unfortunately, too, our woodcutters brought
us only driftwood, which had lain so long in the water that
it would not burn. Picotte had sent a small cask of wine
by our people, as a present from Mr. Mc Kenzie for the
Mandans, which was delivered to the chiefs for distribution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 6th, there was a
fall of snow; the temperature in the open air was 29&deg; Fahrenheit,
in our room only 25&deg;. The wind blew from the west,
and at noon the snow was mixed with rain, so that the water
dripped on our books and papers from the loft, which was
covered with snow. The robes and hair of the Indians were
wet, and they very unceremoniously, therefore, came to dry
themselves before our fire; this was not very agreeable,
nevertheless we were glad that we could resume our usual
occupations. At noon the temperature was 39&frac12;&deg; Fahrenheit,
and in the evening it became considerably warmer, so
that we could leave our hands at liberty during the night,
without their being affected by the cold. The night, however,
was very stormy, and Sih-Chida laid himself down to
sleep on the ground before our fire. These changes of temperature
were very remarkable. On the 7th we again had
cold, with a tempestuous west wind; at noon, the thermometer
stood at 12&deg;, and in the afternoon it again snowed. Sih-Chida
once more passed the night with us, and, when all
was silent, made a long address to the lord of life, in which
he besought him to send buffaloes, that they might not
starve. He spoke in a rapid half-suppressed tone of reproach,
and without any gesticulation.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> On the following
day, Dreidoppel went into the forest in quest of game, but
could not proceed on account of the drifted snow; he only
saw some flocks of prairie hens. At noon, when I went to
look at the thermometer, I found that it had been stolen by
the Indians. Our {438} friend Sih-Chida immediately ran
out, and discovered the instrument concealed by a woman
under her robe, and, to my great joy, brought it back to
me. Bidda-Chohki (generally called La Chevelure lev&eacute;e,
the scalped man), visited us, and gave me some words of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>the Manitari language, but he was not in a very good humour,
because he could not get any brandy. The next day this
man dressed himself very handsomely in order to have his
portrait taken, but the mercury was again 20&deg; below zero,
and it was too cold in our room to paint, for colours and
pencils were frozen, though standing close to the fire, and
had to be thawed in hot water. We calculated that we
should burn in our chimney at least six cords of wood in a
month if this cold continued. Mato-Top&eacute; had become reconciled
to Pehriska-Ruhpa, and purchased a green blanket,
which he showed to us, as a present for him. We heard that
a wolf had attacked three Indian women in the forest, who
had been obliged to defend themselves with their hatchets.</p>

<p>On the 14th of January, the cold was only 8&deg; below zero,
but there was such a high, piercing wind, that our woodcutters
complained more than when the cold was more severe.
In these prairies it is, for the most part, the wind which
makes the cold intolerable; and though persons who ventured
out wore woollen caps which left only the eyes exposed,
yet their faces were frostbitten. Our provisions were
very bad, for Picotte had sent us only tough, hard, stale
meat, besides which we had nothing but maize and beans,
and the water of the river. Mato-Top&eacute;, in his finest dress,
accompanied by many Indians, visited us. He wore a large
hood of red cloth, adorned with forty long eagles' feathers,
and was going to Ruhptare, where a medicine son was to
be adopted.</p>

<p>In the night of the 14th, the wind blew with such violence,
that it scattered the heap of ashes from the fire place all over
the room, so that our beds, benches, and clothes were completely
covered with them. Mato-Top&eacute; returned on this
day from Ruhptare, and told us, with great satisfaction and
self-complacency, that he had enumerated all his exploits,
and that no one had been able to surpass him. Old Garreau,
who was constantly with our <i>engag&eacute;s</i> in the fort, complained
to me, that, for a long time, he had lived on nothing
but maize boiled in water; and this was really the case with
many persons at this place, as game became more and more
scarce. When Garreau first came to these parts, game
abounded, and beavers were heard in all the streams, striking
with their tails; now, however, even the Indians are
often reduced to want of food. On the 21st of January,
while the Indians passed the night without fire, in the prairie,
in order to hunt, the thermometer was at 30&deg; below 0 (27&frac12;&deg;
Reaumur); the wind was easterly, and pretty high. The
land and the river were covered by a dense mist, through
which the sun penetrated when just above the horizon; on
either side was a large crescent, which rose as high as the
upper surface of the mist, the eastern one extending to the
frozen surface of the river. They were at some distance
from the sun, {439} and, like it, appeared of a light yellowish-white
through the misty vapour.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Sometimes we observed,
in the light misty clouds on the horizon, two short, beautifully
coloured rainbows, at some distance from the sun,
which, being interrupted by the upper stratum of clouds,
did not rise to any great height. The snow was now frozen
so hard, that it could be broken into large pieces, which
emitted a clear sound when struck with the foot. In the
sunshine the atmosphere sparkled with innumerable particles
of floating ice. The Indians had cut some holes in the ice
on the Missouri, to procure water, and fenced them round
with poles and brushwood covered with buffalo hides, as
a protection against the cold wind. At noon the weather
was rather milder, the temperature being 10&frac12;&deg; below zero.
Three Yanktonans came to the fort with a view to persuade
the Mandans to join in an expedition against another tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bodmer took a very excellent likeness of Psihdje-Sahpa,
one of the three Yanktonans.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>On the 23rd of January information was brought that a
herd of buffaloes was only six miles from the fort; accordingly,
three <i>engag&eacute;s</i>, with the Arikkara, were sent in pursuit
of them, and returned at night with two cows and a young
bull, two of which were given to the fort. The Mandans
had killed about fifty of this herd: our hunters had almost
all their fingers frozen, but they knew well how to restore
circulation by rubbing the limbs with snow. The Indians
did not visit us so frequently at this time, because they were
well supplied with meat: the Arikkara, however, came to
us to attend a feast in Belhumeur's apartment, where we
were to be regaled with buffalo flesh. On the 29th, the
women of the band of the white buffalo cow, from Ruhptare,
came to the fort to perform their dance, on which occasion
they were dressed in the same manner as the women from
Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush, only they had not the bundles of
brushwood. The musicians were three men, who wore caps
of white buffalo skin. Knives, tobacco, and glass beads
were laid on the ground as presents for them, after which
they proceeded to the lower Mandan village, from which
they came back, the following day, in grand procession,
over the frozen river. Mr. Kipp soon afterwards arrived
from Fort Union, with three or four dog sledges, and six
men: they were completely covered with ice, their noses
and cheeks were {440} livid, and they appeared quite frostbitten.
Besides staying four days with the Manitaries, Mr.
Kipp and his party had been twelve days on their journey
to Fort Union. At the beginning they had nothing to eat;
and the poor dogs had been so completely starved for nine
days, that they could scarcely crawl along, so that no burden
could be laid upon them, and the party were obliged to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the greater part of the way on foot, in deep snow. They
encountered a war party of nine Assiniboins, some of whom
ran away, but the others were sent by Mr. Kipp to hunt, by
which means he procured meat, and the <i>engag&eacute;s</i>, too, succeeded
in killing a few elks and deer. It was affirmed that
the mercury of Fahrenheit's thermometer had been for a
whole fortnight at 45&deg; below zero (77&deg; below freezing point),
at Fort Union. No buffaloes had appeared in the vicinity,
nor any Indians, who remained farther down the river. The
hunters of Fort Union had been absent nearly a month, in
which time they killed only two bulls, two cows, and a calf.
Except in some few places, provisions were extremely scarce
this winter on the whole of the Missouri, from Fort Clarke
upwards. No accounts had been received from Fort Mc Kenzie.
I had wished to receive several articles from Fort Union;
but Mr. Hamilton was not able to send them, the sledge
being too heavily laden; he, however, promised to forward
them without fail, in the spring, with the people who were
to be sent to conduct us down the Missouri to Fort Pi&egrave;rre.
Mr. Kipp had been eleven days on his journey back, and
had again been obliged to perform a considerable part of it
on foot. The dogs had had nothing to eat for three days,
and now the poor beasts were fed with hides cut in pieces, for
we had no meat. Numbers of the fowls in the forest perished
in the cold. On the last day of January there was a change
in the weather; at eight in the morning, with a west wind,
the mercury was at 22&deg; Fahrenheit, and we could scarcely
bear the warmth of the fire in our apartment. Towards
noon a complete thaw set in, and the mild weather immediately
brought us a number of Indian visitors.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February, Mr. Kipp sent three <i>engag&eacute;s</i>,
with two dog sledges, down the river, to the post among the
Yanktonans, which was under the superintendence of Picotte,
to procure meat, for we subsisted entirely on maize broth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and maize bread, and were without tallow for candles; the
dogs that were sent with the <i>engag&eacute;s</i> howled most piteously
when they were harnessed, their feet being still sore and
bleeding from the effects of their late journey. On this
day news was received from Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush, that
three hostile Indians (Assiniboins), had been in the village
during the night, for the purpose of shooting somebody, for
in the morning the place where they had concealed themselves
was discovered, from one of the party having left his
knee-band behind. They had not been able to fire through
the wall of the hut, and had retired at daybreak without attaining
their object; traces were also found of some hostile
Indians, who had come over the river.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of February, one of the sledges sent to
Picotte came back, having been broken on the way. The
man who came with it fell in with the Mandans, who were
going to hunt {441} buffaloes, and detained him, lest he should
frighten the animals away. In the preceding night, the
Assiniboins had stolen three horses from the Manitaries,
150 of whom immediately mounted their horses to pursue
and kill them.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock on the morning of the 3rd, the thermometer
stood at 39&deg;; the face of the country had assumed quite
a different aspect; large tracts of land were wholly free from
the snow, which was fast melting away, and only the hills
were partially covered; yet, with this rapid thaw, the ground
had not become wet, for it was immediately dried by the
continual wind; but there was a considerable quantity of
water on the ice which covered the river. The ravens and
magpies again flew about in the prairie in quest of food.</p>

<p>In the afternoon news was received that the Manitaries,
who had gone in pursuit of the Assiniboins, had overtaken
a small party, and killed a young man, whom they had found
asleep, cruelly awakened with whips, and then murdered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
cold blood. These Assiniboins are very daring, and often
approach the villages of the Mandans and Manitaries, either
singly or in small parties, and sometimes surprise individuals
and shoot them. Thus an Assiniboin suddenly fired at a
number of young people who were standing near the palisades
of the village, and killed one of them. The others
raised an alarm, while the murderer took the scalp of the
youth he had killed, fled down the steep bank of the river,
where many persons were bathing, and made his escape
through the very midst of all these people. Other Assiniboins
stole eleven horses from a Manitari hut, and were not
even perceived till they were in the act of leading off the
last of the animals. They stole four horses from a hut in
which Charbonneau was sleeping, and made their escape
with their booty, without being seen by any one. To-day
arrows were found sticking in the huts and posts of the village,
which they had discharged at random during the night
in the hope of killing one of their foes.</p>

<p>On the 4th and 5th, the weather was mild; the horses
were again sent out to graze in the prairie, our waggons went
to fetch grass, and, towards noon, the day was really quite
warm. We were still without meat, none of the parties
whom we sent out having been able to procure any. Our
stock of tallow, too, was exhausted, and we were obliged
to content ourselves with the light of the fire. For several
succeeding days, the weather being still mild, we were much
interested in watching the activity of the Indians on the
river; among them a number of women brought heavy burdens,
especially of wood, from the lower forest village, to
Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush. They had to pass, opposite the
fort, a channel formed through the midst of the frozen river,
which was covered with a thin coat of ice; this they broke
very deliberately with their long poles, and then waded
through. Some carried their small leathern boats to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
channel, in this they deposited the wood, and then pushed
it along. The manner in which they took up the heavy
burdens was remarkable. A woman lay down on her back,
upon the bundle of wood, while another raised her with the
burden till she was able to bend forward, and then stand
upright with her load. A great many women were thus
{442} occupied, for the Indians were desirous of going to
their summer village, because they were now too much
scattered to be safe while the enemy was so near at hand.</p>

<p>On the 9th of February the inhabitants of Ruhptare had
all removed from their winter to their summer quarters;
they were evidently afraid that the ice would break up
early, and the water of the Missouri rise considerably.</p>

<p>On the 10th, two of our people came from Picotte, with a
sledge drawn by two dogs, and informed us that there were
many buffaloes in the neighbourhood, consequently our
fear of want of provisions was dispelled. At Fort Pi&egrave;rre,
on the River Teton, the cold had been more intense than
had been known for many years, the mercury having remained
for a considerable time between 30&deg; and 40&deg; below
zero. Three of Mr. Laidlow's people,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> who were travelling
at the time, had suffered so severely from the frost, that
their lives were despaired of. The ice of the Missouri had,
for a few days, been very unfavourable for travelling, as
it was covered to some depth with water, and our people,
consequently, had suffered much. In the afternoon of that
day, the Manitari chief, Lachpitzi-Sirish (the yellow bear),
arrived, bringing on his horse a small supply of meat, and
a young buffalo calf, which he presented to us, this disgusting
little black animal being reckoned a great dainty by
them. His robe was painted with suns, and on his back he
carried his bow, with a beautifully ornamented quiver of
panther's skin. Charbonneau immediately accommodated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>him in his bed room. On the following day we sent a couple
of our hunters to Fort Union, with letters to Mr. Mc Kenzie.
The fort was crowded with Manitaries who wished to perform
before us the scalp dance, in commemoration of having slain
an enemy on the preceding day. A number of tall, handsomely
dressed men, having their faces blackened, soon
filled every apartment. Itsichaika (the monkey-face), and
the other chiefs, had arrived, and these Indians, who are
not nearly so well behaved as the Mandans, very deliberately
took possession of all our seats and fireplaces. We bolted
the door of our own apartment, where we quietly remained,
permitting only a very few of the Indians to enter.</p>

<p>At two o'clock the Manitari women arrived in procession,
accompanied by many children and some Mandans. Eighteen
women, marching two and two in a close column, entered
the court-yard of the fort, with a short-measured, slow
pace. Seven men of the band of the dogs, having their
faces painted black, or black striped with red, acted as
musicians, three of them having drums, and four the schischiku&eacute;.
They were wrapped in their buffalo robes, and
their heads were uncovered, and ornamented with the feathers
of owls and other birds. The faces of some of the women
were painted black, others red, while some were striped
black and red. They wore buffalo dresses, or blankets, and
the two principal were enveloped in the white buffalo robe.
The greater part of them had the feather of a war eagle
standing upright, and one only wore the large handsome
feather cap. In their arms they carried battle-axes or guns,
ornamented with red cloth and short black feathers, which,
during the dance, they placed with the butt-end on the {443}
ground; in short, while performing this dance, the women
are accoutred in the military dress and weapons of the
warriors. The right wing was headed by the wife of the
chief, Itsichaika, who carried in her hand a long elastic rod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
from the point of which was suspended the scalp of the
young man slain on the preceding day, surmounted by a
stuffed magpie with outspread wings;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> lower down on the
same rod hung a second scalp, a lynx skin, and a bunch
of feathers. Another woman bore a third scalp on a similar
rod. The women filed off in a semicircle; the musicians,
taking their stand on the left wing, now commenced a heterogeneous
noise, beating the drum, rattling the schischiku&eacute;,
and yelling with all their might. The women began to
dance, waddling in short steps, like ducks; the two wings,
or horns of the crescent, advanced towards each other, and
then receded, at the same time singing in a shrill tone of
voice. It was a complete caterwaul concert. After awhile
they rested, and then recommenced, and continued dancing
about twenty minutes. The director of the fort now caused
tobacco, looking-glasses, and knives, from the Company's
stores, to be thrown on the ground in the middle of the circle.
Hereupon the women once more danced in quick time, the
musicians forming themselves into a close body, and holding
their instruments towards the centre. This concluded
the festivity, and the whole band retired to the Mandan
forest village.</p>

<p>There was a heavy fall of snow during the night, and the
morning of the 12th again presented the landscape clothed
with its white covering. Mr. Bodmer had taken an excellent
portrait of Machsi-Nika, the deaf and dumb Mandan,
in his war dress. He came to our residence to-day with
angry gestures, and evidently greatly enraged against us, so
that I was afraid that this half-witted, uncivilized man would
attack the artist. Mr. Kipp was requested to clear up the
matter, and it appeared that his anger had been caused by
a malignant insinuation of the perfidious old Garreau, who
had pointed out to him that Bodmer had drawn him only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in a mean dress, while all the other Indians were represented
in their handsomest robes. This ill-natured insinuation completely
exasperated the poor man, and we in vain endeavoured
to pacify him, by assuring him that we intended to
make him known to the world in a truly warlike costume.
Mr. Bodmer then thought of an expedient: he quickly and
secretly made a copy of his drawing, which he brought in,
tore in half, and threw into the fire, in the presence of the
Indian. This had the desired effect, and he went away
perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Manitaries returned from the Mandan
village, and again took deliberate possession of the various
apartments of the fort. The Monkey-face, a cunning, perfidious
Indian, who wore a new red felt hat, is the chief
who now takes the lead among the Manitaries. Accordingly,
as soon as he took leave, all the Indians followed him. One
of the chiefs, with his family, sat a long time in our room,
and were much interested with Mr. Bodmer's drawings, and
astonished and delighted with our musical box. A Mandan
who was present thought that a little white man, who was
making this pretty music, must be concealed in it. All of
them asked for presents, {444} and they would certainly have
pilfered many things if we had not kept close watch over
them. At length our door was opened, and a tall, heavy man,
with a blackened face, entered, and, like all the rest assembled
there, demanded something to eat. We, however, gave
him to understand that we had nothing to give them, as
we were supplied by Mr. Kipp, and with this answer they
were obliged to be satisfied. Towards evening our provision
store was replenished by three sledges, laden with
meat, sent by Picotte, which arrived in the fort.</p>

<p>On the following day, a very high, cold wind arose, which
blew the snow off from the ice that covered the river, and the
Indian women, carrying their burdens, frequently fell down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
on the slippery surface. The Mandans had found a dead
buffalo cow in the prairie, and, although it was in part decayed,
they greedily devoured it.</p>

<p>On the 17th, at eight in the morning, with a temperature
of 1&deg; below 0, the woods were covered with hoar frost; the
wind blew from the south, and veered to the southwest;
the river had risen considerably, and, in some places, overflowed
its banks. The sledges had much difficulty in crossing
the river without getting into the water, and the ice broke
under one of them. At noon, the temperature was 10&deg;, and
afterwards there was a fall of snow. Dreidoppel shot a
beautiful red fox in the prairie, but had no success against
the wolves. The Mandans told us, that they had gone,
some days before, to hunt buffaloes, and had driven a herd
of them towards the mountains, where there is a good opportunity
to use the bow and arrows; they had, therefore, pursued
the animals rapidly, but, on reaching them, they found
but a very few buffaloes, the others, as they affirmed, having
sunk into the ground: they had, doubtless, taken refuge in
the nearest ravines. They assigned, as the cause of this
sudden disappearance of the buffaloes, that their party was
headed by a man who, in the preceding year, had caused
five Assiniboins, who had come to them as messengers of
peace, to be killed, and that, on account of this unjust act,
he was now always unsuccessful in hunting.</p>

<p>The mercury remained now a little above or below zero,
but at noon the sun had much power, and the reflection
from the snow was very dazzling, which induced our hunters
to make for themselves wooden snow spectacles, in the manner
of the Esquimaux. The dumb Mandans had been successful
in hunting, and brought several horse-loads of meat,
which we bought of them. In the afternoon, when the temperature
was 8&deg; or 9&deg;, I heard an Indian child crying at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
door of our room; it had touched a piece of iron with its
tongue, and the skin immediately came off.</p>

<p>At daybreak, on the 27th, in the morning, the mercury
was at 26&deg;, Fahrenheit, below zero, or 59&deg; below freezing
point; and at 8 o'clock, when the sun shone brightly, at 11&deg;
below zero, with a west wind. During the night, the horses
had broken a window in Mr. Kipp's room, so that we had
a very cold breakfast there. In our apartments everything
fluid was frozen, and the quilts on the beds were covered
with hoar frost. We had now some fresh meat, but our
stock of sugar was at an end, and we had to sweeten our
coffee with treacle. We were visited by the three {445} deaf
and dumb Mandans, whose fourth brother, Berock-Itainu,
whom we have before mentioned, is not so afflicted: there
is, likewise, a deaf and dumb child in the village. Kiasax,
the Blackfoot, who had accompanied us to Fort Union,
visited us to-day for the first time, and we showed him the
portraits of his countrymen, with which he was much
pleased. The Indians were busy in conveying many things
to the summer village, though the prairies were covered with
snow; and numerous horses were seeking a scanty subsistence
by scraping it away with their hoofs to get at the dry
grass.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, Mr. Kipp had pieces of ice hewn
on the river to fill his ice cellar. A high west wind increased
the cold, but the snow melted away because the thermometer
was at 38&deg; at noon. We saw the Indian boys pursue and
catch the snow-buntings, of which there were large flocks
in the neighbourhood of the villages; and the prairie wolves
now prowled about in couples: in the evening there was a
heavy fall of snow. The Indians removed to their village: all
their horses, even the foals, were loaded: they likewise cut
blocks of ice from the river, which the women carried home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
on their backs, in leather baskets, in order to melt them to
obtain water. The Indian children amused themselves with
ascending the heaps of snow, and gliding down on a board,
or a piece of the back-bone of a buffalo, with some of the
ribs attached to it. Mato-Top&eacute; paid us a visit in a very
strange costume; his head-dress was much more suitable
for an old woman than for a warrior. His head was bound
round with a strip of wolf's skin, the long hairs of which
stood on end, and which hung down behind. Some feathers,
standing upright, were placed among the hair, which, except
at the tip, were stripped, and painted red. This chief, indeed,
had on a different dress almost every time he came
to see us. Sometimes he wore a blue uniform, with red
facings, which he had obtained from the merchants. Mr.
Bodmer took the portrait of a handsome Manitari partisan
to-day.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He was not pleased that we intended to keep
his portrait, as he was going on a military expedition, and
said that Mr. Bodmer ought, at least, to give him a copy of
the drawing. This being refused, he drew a portrait of the
artist, and his performance showed that he possessed some
talent for the art.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 28th of February, Picotte sent up
the letter-bag from St. Louis, and I had the pleasure of
receiving despatches from Germany, with very agreeable intelligence.
This post was forwarded, on the 2nd of March,
to Fort Union, by two of the <i>engag&eacute;s</i> in dog-sledges. Bodmer
drew the portrait of an old Manitari, whose proper
name was Birohka (the robe with the beautiful hair), but
the Mandans called him "Long Nose," on account of the
prominence of that feature. He wore a cap of white buffalo
skin, and an ample brown robe painted with wreaths of
feathers; before he would suffer his portrait to be taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
he demanded a black silk neckerchief as a recompense,
which was given him.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> As all the Indians had now removed
to their summer village,{446} Mr. Kipp took the usual complement
of soldiers into the fort, four of whom served as a
guard against the importunities of the women and children;
they were Mato-Top&eacute;, Dipauch, Berock-Itainu, and another
whose name I do not know. The first never smoked his
pipe in another person's room, if anybody stirred from his
place or looked at him. We had some interesting conversations
with several sensible and inquiring Indians, especially
with the soldiers of the fort.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 5th of March, the mercury being
at 29&deg;, we had a very severe snow storm from the north,
which continued till near ten o'clock. On the following
day, Mato-Top&eacute; introduced to us a tall, robust Arikkara,
named Pachtuwa-Chta, who lived peaceably among the
Mandans. He was a handsome man, but not to be depended
upon, and was said to have killed many white men.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Another tall man of the same nation frequently visited us,
generally observing that he was not like Pachtuwa, as he
had never killed a white man. Mato-Top&eacute;, after repeated
solicitations, prevailed on Mr. Bodmer to paint for him a
white-headed eagle, holding in his claws a bloody scalp, to
which he, doubtless, attached some superstitious notion,
but I could not see exactly what it might be. Mato-Top&eacute;
gave me very accurate information respecting his own language,
and that of the neighbouring Indian nations, and
took great pleasure in communicating to me some words of
the Mandan and Arikkara languages, the latter of which
he spoke fluently.</p>

<p>On the 7th of March, the band of the Meniss-Ochata
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>(dog band), from Ruhptare, danced in the medicine lodge
at Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush. Mr. Bodmer went to see the
dance, and met Mato-Top&eacute;, who, however, puffed up by
his high dignity as a dog, would not notice him. Sih-Chida,
who also belonged to this band, went into the lodge, where
he discharged his gun. In the afternoon the band approached
the fort, and we heard the sound of their war pipes at the
gates. A crowd of spectators accompanied the seven or
eight and twenty dogs, who were all dressed in their handsomest
clothes. Some of them wore beautiful robes, or
shirts of bighorn leather; others had shirts of red cloth; and
some blue and red uniforms. Others, again, had the upper
part of their body naked, with their martial deeds painted
on the skin with reddish-brown colour. The four principal
dogs wore an immense cap hanging down upon the shoulders,
composed of raven's or magpie's feathers, finished at the
tips with small white down feathers. In the middle of this
mass of feathers, the outspread tail of a wild turkey, or of
a war eagle, was fixed. These four principal dogs wore
round their neck a long slip of red cloth, which hung down
over the shoulders, and, reaching the calf of the leg, was tied
in a knot in the middle of the back. These are the true dogs,
who, when a piece of meat is thrown into the fire, are bound
immediately to snatch it out and devour it raw.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Two
other men wore similar colossal caps of yellow owl's feathers,
with dark transverse stripes, and the rest had on their
heads a thick tuft of raven's, magpie's, or owl's feathers,
which is the badge of the band. All of them had the {447}
long war pipe suspended from their necks. In their left
hand they carried their weapons&mdash;a gun, bow and arrows,
or war club; and in their right hand the schischiku&eacute; peculiar
to their band. It is a stick adorned with blue and white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>glass beads, with buffalo or other hoofs suspended to it, the
point ornamented with an eagle's feather, and the handle
with slips of leather embroidered with beads.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The warriors formed a circle round a large drum, which
was beaten by five ill-dressed men, who were seated on the
ground. Besides these, there were two men, each beating
a small drum like a tambourine. The dogs accompanied
the rapid and violent beat of the drum by the whistle of their
war pipes, in short, monotonous notes, and then suddenly
began to dance. They dropped their robes on the ground,
some dancing within the circle, with their bodies bent forward
and leaping up and down with both feet placed close together.
The other Indians danced without any order, with
their faces turned to the outer circle, generally crowded together;
while the war pipe, drum, and schischiku&eacute; made a
frightful din.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March, two <i>engag&eacute;s</i>, sent by Picotte, arrived,
with letters and a sledge laden with dried meat. One
of these men was blinded by the snow, a circumstance very
usual in this month, from the dazzling reflection of the sun
from an expansive surface of snow. He was obliged to
get his companion to lead him by taking hold of the end of
his stick.</p>

<p>On the 11th of March I felt the first symptoms of an indisposition,
which daily increased, and soon obliged me to
take to my bed. It began with a swelling in one knee, and
soon extended to the whole leg, which assumed the colour
of dark, extravasated blood. A violent fever succeeded,
with great weakness, and, having neither medical advice
nor suitable remedies, my situation became daily more helpless
and distressing, as there was nobody who had any knowledge
of this disorder. The other inhabitants of the fort were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
likewise indisposed, and our provisions were very bad and
scanty. To economize our stock of coffee we were forced
to make it wretchedly weak, and, for want of sugar or treacle,
to sweeten it with honey, of which we had about twenty
pounds. Our beverage was, generally speaking, the water
from the river; and, as our supply of beans was very low
our diet consisted almost exclusively of maize boiled in water,
which greatly weakened our digestion.</p>

<p>The man blinded by the snow was so far recovered on
the 13th, that he was able to return to Picotte. The first
wild ducks were seen on this day, flying up the Missouri,
and Mr. Kipp immediately set about making shot, to go
in pursuit of these birds, which we had been most anxiously
expecting. On the 14th, a store (<i>cache</i>) of maize was opened
in the fort, the contents of which were perfectly dry, and in
good preservation. Pehriska-Ruhpa spent several days with
us, in order to have his portrait taken in his dress of one of
the chiefs of the dog band. When the sitting was over, he
always took off his ponderous feather cap, and rubbed it
twice on each side of his head, a charm or precaution which
he never neglected. He then seated himself {448} with his
friend, Mato-Top&eacute;, by the fire-side, when both took their
pipes, the latter, however, always turning round first, and
making everybody in the room sit down. During the tedium
of my confinement to bed, I was enlivened by the frequent
visits of the Indians, and I never neglected to continue my
journal, which, from fever and consequent weakness, was
often very fatiguing. Mr. Kipp kindly sent me some new-laid
eggs every day, as well as rice, which he had reserved
for me, and from which I derived great benefit. The inmates
of the fort had nothing to eat but doughy maize bread
and maize boiled in water; but Mr. Kipp, who did not like
the latter, was obliged to fast.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March, the first wild swans were seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
flying towards the northwest. Ducks were in the pools
of water in the maize plantations of the Mandans; and
Dreidoppel had observed the <i>Fringilla Canadensis</i>, as a
harbinger of spring. Violent storms from the northwest
had prevailed for some days; the Missouri was much swollen,
but the breaking-up of the ice could not yet be expected,
and we had repeated falls of snow. Mato-Top&eacute; and Pehriska-Ruhpa,
who had gone out to hunt, succeeded in killing five
buffaloes, and from them we obtained some meat; for, to
show their liberality, they gave away a great deal of it, together
with several coloured blankets. The first white-headed
eagle (<i>Aquila leucocephala</i>) was seen to-day; and
I received the first prairie dog, which was also a sign of the
approach of spring, as these animals leave their burrows at
this season. On the 27th of March, the band of the mad
dogs danced in the fort; and, towards evening, an Indian
from Ruhptare, who had had a dispute with Mr. Kipp about
a beaver skin, revenged himself by breaking a pane of glass
in our room. Our people pursued, but could not overtake
him. As it was feared that he might commit greater acts
of violence, the soldiers of the fort were sent to Ruhptare
on the 28th, to protect a fur trader who resided there.</p>

<p>On the 30th, the first flock of fifteen or twenty wild geese
passed over: the wind was high, and, on the following day,
a good deal of ice broke up in the river. On the 1st of
April the wind blew stormy, with a thermometer of 33&deg; at
noon. On the 2nd, the women at Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush
celebrated the spring corn feast, of which Mr. Bodmer made
a sketch. This feast is always observed on the return of
the wild geese, which are the messengers of the old woman
who never dies. The Indians had already killed some
of these birds. The festival was over at eleven o'clock in
the forenoon, but some of the women remained the whole
day, reclining near the offerings hung up in the prairie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Great numbers of young men were running races, and all
was animation about the village.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of April, the band of the Ischoha-Kakoschochata,
eighteen in number, danced in the fort, led by Mato-Top&eacute;,
on horseback, in full dress, wearing his splendid
feather cap. The ice broke up so rapidly in the river, that
it was necessary to set a watch over our boats during the
night, lest the rising water should carry them away. On
the following day the icy covering of {449} the river gave
way, but soon froze again, only leaving a channel across
the middle. Many ducks and geese, as well as a plover,
appeared on the ice. On the 5th of April, the weather being
stormy in the morning, and the temperature 59&frac12;&deg; Fahrenheit,
the river had risen about a foot, and towards noon it suddenly
rose between three and four feet more, so that, at twelve
o'clock, the ice on the surface began to move, the temperature
being 68&deg;. But in the night the river again fell a foot,
and there was a slight frost. At nine in the evening the
temperature was 55&deg;, and we had a storm of thunder and
lightning.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April there was but little floating ice on
the river, which had fallen during the night. We saw several
swans. On the 8th the Manitaries danced the scalp dance
in the fort, and the Indians amused themselves in the prairie
with races and various games. At one o'clock in the afternoon,
the ice in the upper Missouri suddenly broke up, and
brought down many trunks of trees, which endangered our
boats. The Indians immediately availed themselves of this
opportunity to land a good deal of the wood; they also brought
ashore a drowned elk, which, though already in a state of
decomposition, they actually ate, and the smith of the fort,
a Canadian, did not disdain to partake of it with them.
Some dead buffaloes likewise floated by, and the Indians
followed them, for the same purpose. In the evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
though the quantity of ice was considerably diminished,
yet some people who were to have gone down the river
were obliged to defer their voyage.</p>

<p>The morning of the 9th of April being fine and serene,
and the ice having almost entirely disappeared from the
river, seven men were sent down to Picotte in Indian leather
boats. The grass began to sprout, and some young plants
appeared in the prairie, even a pulsatilla, with purple blossoms,
apparently the same as the <i>P. vulgaris</i> of Europe;
the Indians call this plant the red calf-flower. At noon the
thermometer stood at 65&deg;, with a northeast wind, and the
river was free from ice. Towards evening, nine men of
the band of the buffalo bulls came to the fort to perform
their dance, discharging their guns immediately on entering.
Only one of them wore the entire buffalo head;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the others
had pieces of the skin of the forehead, a couple of fillets of
red cloth, their shields decorated with the same material,
and an appendage of feathers, intended to represent the
bull's tail, hanging down their backs. They likewise carried
long, elegantly ornamented banners in their hands. After
dancing for a short time before us, they demanded presents.
Besides the strange figures of this dance, Mr. Bodmer painted
the chief, Mato-Top&eacute;, at full length, in his grandest dress.
The vanity which is characteristic of the Indians induced
this chief to stand stock-still for several days, so that his
portrait succeeded admirably.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> He wore on this occasion
a handsome new shirt of bighorn leather, the large feather
cap, and, in his hand, a long lance with scalps and feathers.
He has been so often mentioned in my narrative, that I
must here subjoin a few words respecting this eminent man,
for he was fully entitled to this appellation, being not only
a distinguished warrior, but possessing many fine and noble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>traits of character. {450} In war he had always maintained
a distinguished reputation; and on one occasion, with great
personal danger, he conducted to Fort Clarke a numerous
deputation of the Assiniboins, who had come to Mih-Tutta-Hang-Kush
to conclude peace, while his countrymen, disregarding
the proposals, kept firing upon the deputies.
Mato-Top&eacute;, after having in vain exerted himself to the utmost
to prevent these hostilities, led his enemies, with slow steps,
amidst the whistling balls and the arrows of his countrymen,
while he endeavoured to find excuses for their culpable
conduct. He had killed many enemies, among whom were
five chiefs. He gives a facsimile of a representation of one
of his exploits, painted by himself, of which he frequently
gave me an account.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He was, on that occasion, on foot,
on a military expedition, with a few Mandans, when they
encountered four Chayennes, their most virulent foes, on
horseback. The chief of the latter, seeing that their enemies
were on foot, and that the combat would thereby be unequal,
dismounted, and the two parties attacked each other. The
two chiefs fired, missed, threw away their guns, and seized
their naked weapons; the Chayenne, a tall, powerful man,
drew his knife, while Mato-Top&eacute;, who was lighter and more
agile, took his battle-axe. The former attempted to stab
Mato-Top&eacute;, who laid hold of the blade of the knife, by
which he, indeed, wounded his hand, but wrested the weapon
from his enemy, and stabbed him with it, on which the
Chayennes took to flight. Mato-Top&eacute;'s drawing of the scene
in the above-named plate, shows the guns which they had
discharged and thrown aside, the blood flowing from the
wounded hand of the Mandan chief, the footsteps of the two
warriors, and the wolf's tail at their heels&mdash;the Chayenne
being distinguished by the fillet of otter skin on his forehead.
The buffalo robe, painted by Mato-Top&eacute; himself, and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>I have fortunately brought to Europe, represents several
exploits of this chief, and, among others, in the lower figure
on the left hand, the above-mentioned adventure with the
Chayenne chief.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The 10th of April was warm and fine, the thermometer
at noon at 80&deg;, the wind south, and the river had fallen three
feet. Several of our Indian friends, among whom was Sih-Chida,
had taken leave, intending to assist a large party
of Manitaries and Mandans in a military expedition. They
set out on their march about this time, and we afterwards
learnt that a war party of the Manitaries had completely
plundered a couple of beaver hunters, white men; and that
their partisan, whose name was Pierce Iron, had acted the
principal part on this occasion. On the other hand, the
Assiniboins had stolen thirty-four horses from the Manitaries,
who shot one of the thieves.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 14th of April, the people whom
Mr. Mac Kenzie had promised to send to accompany me down
the river to Saint Louis, at length arrived from Fort Union.
There were, however, many others with them, and the whole
party amounted to twenty men, among whom were Belhumeur
and Mr. Chardon as leader. The violent storm on
the preceding days had hindered them from travelling, and
they were obliged to halt. They brought us letters from
{451} Fort Union, and news from Fort Mc Kenzie. As
my people could now be spared, I looked daily for the arrival
of Picotte, who, with many men, was to go up to Fort
Union, as, without the help of his men, my Mackinaw
boat could not be caulked. A main point now was my recovery,
which was singularly rapid. At the beginning of
April I was still in a hopeless condition, and so very ill, that
the people who visited me did not think that my life would
be prolonged beyond three or, at the most, four days. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
cook of the fort, a negro from St. Louis, one day expressed
his opinion that my illness must be the scurvy, for he had
once witnessed the great mortality among the garrison of the
fort at Council Bluffs, when several hundred soldiers were
carried off in a short time; of this there is an account in
Major Long's expedition to the Rocky Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> He said
that the symptoms were in both cases nearly similar; that,
on that occasion, at the beginning of spring, they had
gathered the green herbs in the prairie, especially the small
white flowering <i>Allium reticulatum</i>, with which they had
soon cured the sick. I was advised to make trial of this,
recipe, and the Indian children accordingly furnished me
with an abundance of this plant and its bulbs: these were
cut up small, like spinage, and I ate a quantity of them.
On the fourth day the swelling of my leg had considerably
subsided, and I gained strength daily. The evident prospect
of speedy recovery quite reanimated me, and we carried on
with pleasure the preparations for our departure, though I
was not yet able to leave my bed.</p>

<p>On the 15th of April, Picotte arrived with about twenty
men, and had his boat laden with maize, which he was to
carry to Fort Union. They immediately set about preparing
the Mackinaw boat for our voyage down the river, and
Picotte set out on the 16th, notwithstanding a heavy rain.
Every preparation was completed on the following day; the
boat was brought to the landing-place, furnished on the deck
with a spacious Indian tent covering, and all was made ready
for our voyage, Mr. Chardon resolving to accompany me
to Fort Pi&egrave;rre on the Teton River.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April, at noon, the boat was loaded; and,
after we had partaken of our last frugal dinner at Fort Clarke,
we took a cordial farewell of Mr. Kipp, with whom we had
passed so long a time in this remote place, and who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
done everything for me that was possible in his circumscribed
condition. Accompanied by the inhabitants of the
fort, and many of our Indian friends, among whom was
Mato-Top&eacute; and Pehriska-Ruhpa, all of whom shook hands
at parting, we went on board our boat. The weather was
favourable, though there was a strong wind from the southwest.
Some cannon-shot were fired by the fort as a farewell
salute, and we glided rapidly down the beautiful stream
of the Missouri.</p>

<p>Spring had but partially clothed the surrounding prairies
with new verdure, even the willow bushes, which are generally
the most forward, had scarcely assumed a slight tint of
green; and, though some solitary ducks appeared as heralds
of the fine season, the chilly temperature reminded us that
winter was still lingering. On the 18th, we lay to on the right
bank, on the other side of Goose-egg Lake,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and, on the
following morning, encountered a very violent storm, and I
discovered that my pretty prairie fox had escaped during
the night, a loss which I the more regretted, as this rare
animal has, probably, never been brought alive to Europe,
whither I had fondly hoped to carry it. We had now made
all our arrangements for the voyage, and my people had
taken their respective posts. Our steersman, Fecteau, was
very unskilful, and our three rowers, Melone, an American
from the lower Missouri (whose real character we did not
learn till some time after), Bourgua, a Canadian, and an old
Pole, who had roamed half the world over, but was still the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>most industrious of the whole, all proved very indifferent
workmen. Having partaken of our breakfast which was
prepared on the shore, we passed the Butte Carr&eacute;e<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> at
seven o'clock; here we saw a troop of twelve elks, and many
white cranes, swans, wild geese, and ducks of various species.
At twelve o'clock we reached Heart River, where we found
great numbers of wild geese. Our thermometer stood at 61&deg;.
At three o'clock we stopped at Picotte's winter post {453}
among the Yanktonans, to which we had so often sent from
Fort Clarke for supplies of meat, &amp;c., but the house was
now deserted.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In the neighbourhood is a pond, to which
our hunters immediately bent their steps, to shoot water-fowl.
In the vicinity they saw prairie hens, woodpeckers, thrushes,
turkey-buzzards, and birds of prey, also a couple of swans,
one of which they wounded, but did not succeed in securing,
and brought back only a few ducks. In the evening twilight,
when we were about to lay-to, a troop of ten or twelve elks
came down to the river to drink, but one of my people, firing
his piece prematurely, frightened them away, and we thus lost
our chance of taking one of these large animals. During the
night a tremendous storm of rain came from the north; on
the 20th of April the whole country was covered with snow,
and at nine in the morning the thermometer had fallen to 35&deg;.
The storm obliged us to remain at the spot where we had
passed the night, and my people, who always lighted a fire
on shore, found but slight protection from the storm among
the willow bushes. The thermometer, at noon, was at 41&deg;.
The hunters had seen some game, but shot only a prairie
hen, which had a strong taste of garlic, the chief food of this,
bird. The snow ceased to fall at about four o'clock; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>night was cold, and the men who slept near the fire were
aroused by some wild animal, which made them conjecture
that Indians were near, on which Chardon, who had lived
many years among the Osages, set a watch for the rest of
the night.</p>

<p>On the 21st we passed the mouth of Cannonball River.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The hills were sprinkled with snow, and not a vestige of
verdure was to be seen, though, the preceding day, the willows
and rose-bushes had a tinge of green. Our hunters
again set out on an excursion towards a neighbouring lake,
where they saw many cranes and water-fowl, but shot only
a few ducks. Some cabris crossed the river right in front
of us, but, in spite of the exertions of our rowers, we could
not overtake them. We were equally unsuccessful with a
herd of buffalo cows and some bulls. The following day
was again so stormy that we were not able to proceed on
our voyage, and the wind threatened to rend our leathern
tent on deck; the country was covered with snow: towards
evening the wind abated, the night was pleasant, and the
next morning opened upon us calm and cheerful. The
poplar and other thickets were beginning to bud, and some
of the willow bushes were quite green. Cabris were seen
in the prairie, vultures in the air, and pigeons on the bank.</p>

<p>At noon we reached the abandoned Arikkara villages,
and landed a little further down.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> While our dinner was
preparing, Mr. Bodmer and Chardon, well armed, made
an excursion to the forsaken Indian huts, in order to procure
for me some skulls and prairie bulbs. They found the
graves partly turned up by the wolves, and the bodies pulled
out, wrapped in their blankets and robes. They brought
two well preserved male skulls, which I added to my collection;
one of these is now in the anatomical museum of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>the university of Bonn, and the other in the collection of Mr.
Blumenbach at G&ouml;ttingen.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> At half-past four o'clock, when
we had proceeded about ten miles from the villages, and
were opposite the mouth of the Grand River,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> we {454} were
again visited by so heavy a storm, that we were compelled
to lay-to, and light a fire for our people to warm themselves.
While here, a couple of flocks of more than 160 pelicans
passed over us in their way up the river, but we did not
succeed in obtaining any of these fine birds. Towards evening
the storm and rain, mingled with snow, were so extremely
violent, that our boat was driven by the waves against the
stones on the bank, and became leaky. Our people on shore
found no protection under their blankets; they were kept
awake throughout the night, and were frequently obliged
to bale the water out of the boat. Towards midnight there
was a frost, and on the morning of the 24th the country was
again covered with snow. Our effects, which had, in the
first instance, been completely soaked by the water, were
frozen quite stiff. At eight o'clock the thermometer was
at 33&deg;, with a northwest wind. We saw a good deal of
game, and Dreidoppel wounded, at a great distance, a cabri,
in the midst of a troop of eighteen or twenty of those animals,
but unfortunately brought us back nothing but a prairie
dog. In the evening we lay-to at a steep bank opposite the
mouth of Little Chayenne River.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 25th we perceived a couple of
fires burning on the bank, which must have been just left
by some persons, and shortly afterwards we saw, in our van,
two leather boats, which we succeeded in overtaking in about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>an hour's time. The people had halted to make a fire, and
I therefore stopped to hold some conversation with them.
They were Picotte's men, among whom were Ortubize, with
his family, and Papin the hunter, returning to Fort Pi&egrave;rre
from the winter post, with the furs which had been obtained
during that season. While we were conversing with them,
Dreidoppel collected prairie bulbs. Papin gave me a part of
a cabri; and the clerk who directed the boat, and whose
name was likewise Papin, gave me a beautiful swan, but
the large wing feathers were unhappily pulled out. The
weather being very warm and fine, we rested here till eleven
o'clock, and I then received into my boat a couple of women
and a man named Crenier, who had been severely wounded.
We passed the mouth of Big Chayenne River, and halted
in the evening fifteen or twenty miles above Fort Pi&egrave;rre.
The heavily laden leathern boats having likewise come up,
and set up their tents on the bank, we bivouacked together,
and supped magnificently upon our roasted swan.</p>

<p>About two o'clock of the afternoon of the following day
(the 26th), after our boat had several times run aground, we
reached the landing-place at Fort Pi&egrave;rre. Here there was still
snow in the ravines of the mountains, and the bushes were but
just beginning to bud. Several Sioux Indians, who were on the
bank, shook hands with us. Mr. Laidlow, with some clerks
of the Company, came to meet us, and conducted us to the
fort, amidst a salute of several cannon-shot.</p>

<p>Fort Pi&egrave;rre was in excellent condition.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The whole surrounding
plain was covered with scattered tents of the Sioux,
mostly of the Teton branch, and a few Yanktonans. Mr.
Laidlow very kindly accommodated us, and assigned to us a
spacious dwelling: I caused my boat to be {455} unladen,
as it was hinted that the vicinity of the half-starved Indians
might prove dangerous to my bears. We found Fort Pi&egrave;rre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>in great want of fresh provisions, no buffaloes having been
seen during the whole winter, and the inmates of the fort,
as well as the Indians, being very numerous. I could easily
have taken on board, at Fort Clarke, a considerable cargo
of maize for Fort Pi&egrave;rre, but we had not been informed that
there was any scarcity existing here. For his own table,
consisting of ten or twelve persons, Mr. Laidlow had generally
bought dogs of the Indians, but these were now scarce,
and consequently very dear: twelve dollars were paid for
the dog destined for our repast to-day. There were, however,
many superior provisions in the fort, which we enjoyed
at Mr. Laidlow's table, after having long been deprived of
them: one of these luxuries was new wheaten bread, and
there were also potatoes, cabbages, carrots, several kinds of
preserves and pickles, as well as coffee, sugar, tea, &amp;c. I
found here, also, a part of my stock of provisions which I
had brought from St. Louis last year, such as coffee, sugar,
brandy, candles, &amp;c., which would have been invaluable
to me at Fort Clarke. The brandy had, however, been almost
exhausted, and the cask filled up with water.</p>

<p>We were soon invited, with Messrs. Laidlow, Chardon,
Papin, and the old interpreter, Dorion,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> to the tent of one
of the Sioux. After we had taken our seats on a new blanket
ornamented with porcupine quills, the flesh of a dog was
taken from the kettle, and handed to the company. It was
very fat, about the colour of mutton, but the taste was really
so excellent, that we speedily surmounted our prejudice and
antipathy. Other Indians continued coming in, and, ranging
themselves in a circle, commenced smoking, but they
suddenly started up, and left the tent. Mr. Laidlow received
as a present the robe upon which he had sat. Before we
commenced our meal, the host made a formal address to his
visitors, in which he spoke of his attachment to the Whites,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>for which Mr. Laidlow returned thanks through the interpreter.
We went back to Mr. Laidlow, where another fat
roasted dog was served up. Mr. Laidlow's spacious sitting
apartment was filled the whole day with a large party of
Indians, whose chief motive for coming was to see us. Among
them was our old acquaintance, Wah-Menitu,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> who was
rejoiced to see us again. Generally speaking, it was not
Mr. Laidlow's custom to admit the Indians into his own
room.</p>

<p>A high wind prevailed throughout the day, and my people
slept on board the boat. The two bears, which were brought
into the fort, attracted great attention from the Indians,
many of whom were constantly assembled about the animals
to look at them. The prairie in the environs of the fort
was already green, and several small early plants were in
flower. I much regretted that I could not remain long
enough to visit the interesting tract of the Mauvaises Terres,
which is some days' journey from hence. Mr. Laidlow,
who had been there in the winter, gave me a description of
it. It is two days' journey, he said, southwest of Fort
Pi&egrave;rre, and forms, in the level prairie, an accumulation of
hills of most remarkable forms, looking like fortresses,
churches, villages and ruins, and doubtless consisting of the
same sand-stone as the conformations near the Stone Walls.
He further stated that the bighorn abounds in that tract.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>{456} On the 27th of April I visited the stores of the Fur
Company, which contained goods to the amount of 80,000
dollars. In the afternoon some hunters arrived, with twenty
horses, who had been absent about three weeks on a buffalo
chase, but returned with only one horse-load of meat. From
their appearance I should certainly have taken them for
savages. In the afternoon I took a walk in the prairie,
though my strength was not fully restored, and the sight
of the verdant plain was most refreshing to my mind. No
birds were to be seen except the starling (<i>Sturnella ludoviciana</i>),
which enlivened me with its short whistling note.
Below the ridge which bounds the low bank of the river,
the wild plum was covered with its snowy blossoms, which
appear at the same time with the leaves; the scent is exactly
like that of the flowers of our blackthorn. A small
pink flower of the class <i>Tetra dynamia</i> covered the prairie.
The beautiful yellow blossom of the <i>Hyerochloa fragrans</i>
was likewise open. The Indian horses, which graze here,
had now abundance of food, and quickly recovered from
the effects of their fast in the severe winter. I visited the
tents of the Indians, of whom, at least, fifty had gone away
this morning on account of the scarceness of provisions. I
was much struck with the difference of the physiognomy
of the Sioux, after living so long among other tribes. Their
features are much less agreeable, the cheek-bones more
prominent, and their stature is lower and less vigorous than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>that of the Mandans, Manitaries, Arikkaras, and Crows.
On the other hand, the expression of their countenances
is more frank and good-tempered than that of those tribes.
By way of comparison, I subjoin a woodcut of the Little
Soldier, our former travelling companion, who, at this time,
was absent on an expedition.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>{457} Mr. Bodmer took several views of the country, and
also made a sketch of the stage of a distinguished Sioux
warrior, whose remains had been brought from a great
distance with much pomp, and were covered with red cloth.
Groups of Sioux were in the vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> My people erected
a new awning with large tent coverings for our voyage down
the river; and I received, by the kind care of Mr. Laidlow,
many fresh provisions of different kinds, which greatly
contributed to the perfect re-establishment of my health.
On the 29th Mr. Laidlow sent some men with pack-horses,
under the direction of La Chapelle the interpreter, to Fort
Clarke, in order to obtain a supply of maize from Mr. Kipp.</p>

<p>A heavy storm, accompanied with rain, retarded our departure
for some hours, but towards evening the weather
improved, and about six o'clock I was able to take leave of
Mr. Laidlow and the inmates of the fort. The crew of my
Mackinaw boat now consisted of ten persons, for I had obtained
an able rower, named Dauphin, from Carondelet,
near St. Louis, who was, at the same time, a better steersman
than Fecteau. A man named Descoteaux,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> who intended
to sell his beaver skins, of which he possessed about
200, in the United States, requested me to give him a pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>sage,
in return for which he promised to work. I likewise
took on board a sickly young man, who was too weak for
the service of the Fur Company.</p>

<p>We glided rapidly down the Missouri, and soon passed
the mouth of Teton River, which is about two miles and
three quarters distant from Fort Pi&egrave;rre in a south-easterly
direction. At this place, Messrs. Soublette and Campbell,
the opponents of the American Fur Company, had built a
fort, at which I was not able to stop.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> We lay-to, at night,
about six miles from Fort Pi&egrave;rre.</p>

<p>On the 30th of April we had a heavy rain throughout the
day, so that the poor men at the oars were wet through.
Descoteaux, who had remained behind, and had run along
the banks through the whole night in order to overtake us,
made his appearance at eight o'clock, thoroughly soaked.
The weather was so very unfavourable on this day that we
found it necessary to stop repeatedly and kindle a fire, that
the people might dry and warm themselves. We therefore
lay-to a good deal earlier than usual in the evening, near a
very fine wild forest of old red cedars a foot and a half in
diameter. In the evening the rain ceased, and the night
was calm. On the morning of the 1st of May the weather
was very cool: at about six o'clock we reached the Big Bend,
where Dreidoppel and Dauphin landed to seek for game,
while the boat made the great <i>d&eacute;tour</i> on the river.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> They
found a number of impressions of shells on the burnt hills,
and saw a large village of prairie dogs, one of which they
shot; in the dry bed of a stream they found several tents
of the Sioux, the inmates of which met them on horseback,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>and had some amicable conversation with them. At noon
the weather was warm, the thermometer being at 64&deg;, and
at three o'clock we arrived at Sioux Agency, the post of
Major Bean.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Here we found Cephir, the interpreter, and
three white men, who were suffering greatly from want of
provisions. No buffalo herds {458} had been seen here during
the winter, and the men had lived on salt pork and the flesh
of the cabri. The Sioux constantly pursue this animal, and
on our arrival sent one to the fort. They were impatiently
expecting the Company's steam-boat, with which Major
Bean was to return. Thirteen Sioux tents were at this time
near the fort; others had been here waiting for the steamer,
but the want of provisions had forced them to disperse.
It was not long before we received a visit in our boat from
Wahktageli, whose portrait Mr. Bodmer had before taken,
and who now repeated the assurance of his great attachment
to the white men. We took advantage of the fine
evening to prosecute our voyage, and then lay-to on the
north bank. Dreidoppel had shot a duck, and several good-sized
catfish were caught. The croaking of the frogs and
howling of the wolves were our vesper song.</p>

<p>The following morning (2nd of May) was very cool, and
a thick fog hung over the river. We soon passed the mouth
of White River, but the wind becoming too high compelled
us to lay-to on the south bank, where the waves drove the
boat with such violence against the rocky bank, that it
sprung a leak, and let in much water. We found it necessary
to cut down a couple of trees, and fasten the boat to them,
in order to make it more steady. Meantime we made an
excursion to the ravines and hills. Cactus and yucca grew
here in abundance, and some plants of the prairie were
already in flower; and on the banks of the stream the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
foliage was partly eaten away, which was said to have been
done by the porcupines. We found prints of the footsteps
of some game, and, in the dry bed of a brook, traces of the
musk-rat, one of which Mr. Bodmer had killed. We likewise
saw some black-tailed deer, and small hares (<i>Lepus
Americanus</i>), the beautiful yellow-headed oriole, the sparrow-hawk,
the turkey-buzzard, and several other kinds of birds.
We left this place about noon on the 3rd of May, but made
little progress on account of the storm and rain, and lay-to
in the evening on the north bank, not quite a mile beyond
Bijoux Hills.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The storm became very violent during the
night; most of the people slept on land, as they were afraid
that a tree which was standing very obliquely might give
way to the storm and fall on our boat: nothing but the
state of weakness, caused by my illness, could have made me
so indifferent to this danger that I did not attempt to avoid
it. The tree, however, did not fall. The wind abated
towards the morning, and was succeeded by such torrents of
rain, that on the following day (the 4th) we saw the water
pour down from the left bank like cascades, the greater
part of the neighbouring prairie being overflowed. Opposite
to Bijoux Hills we were for a long time aground on a sand
bank. Here we saw the first swallows returning to the
north for the summer. In the afternoon we reached Cedar
Island, and, proceeding a little further, lay-to for the night
on the north bank.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Vegetation was pretty forward; but
no birds had yet come; only the woodpecker and titmouse,
which brave the winter, were to be seen. On the 5th, the
wind being favourable, a sail was hoisted, but at eight o'clock
the wind increased so much that we were obliged to stop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>at a large and beautiful island (Punca Island), where, having
secured the boat, {459} we dispersed in search of game.
When I returned to the boat I learned that Dauphin had
killed an elk calf, and most of my people had gone with him
to the place where the animal lay, in order to secure the
prize. We waited an hour and a half by the fire till they
returned, when I wished immediately to proceed on our
voyage; but Melone, one of my rowers, stepped forward,
and positively declared that he would not go on board till
he had had his fill of the venison, though he had taken a
sufficient portion of meat in the morning. A violent altercation
ensued; the obstinate fellow was compelled to go
on board; but I was now aware of the character of this
troublesome American, who was so much addicted to drinking
that it was necessary to keep a watchful eye over him.
We proceeded through the channel near the island, but at
the further end the wind suddenly caught the vessel, so
that it was quite unmanageable, and the sail was rent. We
crossed over to the south bank, and lay-to near an extensive
thicket of willow. It was so full of climbing plants and
trees, that we could scarcely penetrate into it, and tracks
of wild animals were everywhere to be seen. All the birds
had sought refuge from the storm in the thickest recesses
of the wood, and scarcely a living creature was visible. We
here found, as on our first visit, the beautiful <i>Sylvia coronata</i>
(Latham), and shot a turkey-buzzard, the crop of which
Fecteau took out, affirming that it was an effectual remedy
for the bite of venomous serpents. Towards five o'clock,
as the storm abated, we proceeded on our voyage, passed
the mouth of Punca River, and soon after sunset came to
three tents of the Punca Indians on the south bank, where
the trader, Dixon, with several <i>engag&eacute;s</i> from Fort Pi&egrave;rre,
was at that time residing. Primeau, the Punca interpreter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
who, in the preceding year, when on board the steam-boat,
had communicated to me some words of the Punca language,
was also with these people.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>We were informed that the Fur Company's steamer was
near at hand, on its way up the river, intelligence which
was very agreeable to me. The Punca Indians whom we
saw here had a miserable, dirty appearance, and they, too,
had suffered from want of provisions. They had their hair
cut short in the nape of the neck and across the forehead.
Their leather tents, some of which were painted, stood on a
narrow green plain at the foot of steep hills, where the wood
had been felled and burnt. I here procured the skin of a
skunk, which differed from all the animals of this kind that
I had hitherto seen. It was all over of a blackish-brown
colour, with only a small white stripe on the upper part of
the neck. From this place I crossed the river, and we
kindled our fire in the willow thicket before the steep rocky
hills. This place was directly opposite the mouth of L'Eau
qui Court. At daybreak on the following morning (the
6th of May) we heard the note of the wild turkey, but did
not stop. A large flock of pelicans flew up the Missouri,
and numbers of blackbirds were on the banks. We passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Rivi&egrave;re &agrave; Manuel,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and towards eleven o'clock saw the
Assiniboin steamer, which lay still on the north bank for
want of water. We were hindered by the sand banks and
the high wind from getting up to the Assiniboin, {460} and
therefore lay-to on the south bank, directly opposite. At
this place there was a dense thicket of willows, and behind
it an extensive forest. The woodcutters of the steam-boat
happened to be engaged in felling wood, under the direction
of a clerk, about a mile higher up, and, having observed
our fire, came to us towards noon. A boat was afterwards
sent to fetch them, which brought me a note from Captain
Bennet, commander of the Assiniboin, in which he invited
me to make haste to come on board, as they were impatient
to see me again, after so long an absence. Captain Bennet
also sent a number of men to row my boat across the stormy
river, and with their aid we reached the Assiniboin at noon.
We were received with much joy by our former travelling
companions, Messrs. Sanford, Bean, Bennet, &amp;c., and our
accounts and news from the upper Missouri filled up a good
part of the day. We also found on board our Indian friend,
Schudegacheh, the Punca chief, who was extremely glad to
see me again. There was likewise another chief, and several
Indians. Schudegacheh's dress was remarkably handsome.
His shirt was of beautiful otter skin, with a red cloth
collar: he wore a cap of otter skin, and a tobacco pouch of
the same material. This dress was extremely becoming to
this fine man. The other chief wore a robe painted with
red figures. They had a long conference with their agent,
Major Bean, after which they took off all their clothes, and
laid them on the ground before him, as a present, so that
they sat quite naked, except the breechcloth. Major Bean
at first declined accepting these things, but Schudegacheh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>would not take back his otter garment. The village of
these Indians, consisting of nearly 100 tents, was about
four days' journey up L'Eau qui Court.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>After spending the afternoon and evening on board the
steamer, we took leave of our friends, and returned to our
boat, intending to proceed early on the following morning;
but, to my no small vexation, I found my people in a very
excited state, and partly drunk; Dauphin alone seemed to
know what he was about.</p>

<p>On the following morning (the 7th of May), Fecteau,
Descoteaux, and Melone were still intoxicated, so that our
departure was delayed, and I had to bear the noise and
disorderly conduct of these men. We got over a dangerous
place, where there were many snags; passed, at eleven
o'clock, the mouth of the Rivi&egrave;re &agrave; Jacques, and then, the
wind being very high, lay-to on the right bank.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> My
hunters went to a lake, about a mile off, in the hope of shooting
some water-fowl, but did not succeed. I made my way,
through the willow thicket, to the extensive verdant prairie,
where a red fox sprang up before me. I saw many birds
of various kinds&mdash;swallows, woodpeckers, finches, sylvias,
and a couple of falcons (<i>Falco cyaneus</i>, Cuiv.); likewise
butterflies, among which, <i>Papilio plexippus</i>, and many <i>Libellal&#339;</i>,
in very warm places, sheltered from the wind. When
I returned to the fire, I found my people asleep on the grass,
in consequence of their excesses on the preceding day:
Melone, however, was busy in bringing his trunk and other
things from the boat to the land; after which he stepped
forward and declared that "he {461} would not go any further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>with us, and that his comrades, the other rowers, had
agreed with him to leave us;" so that we Europeans would
have been left alone in this wilderness. The news of this
plot, arranged by the men in their drunken fit, during my
absence yesterday, surprised me not a little. I called the
other people, and asked them if this was really their intention;
but they had now thought better of it, and protested
that they would not leave us. Melone, enraged at their
want of resolution, broke out into violent abuse; so I told
him that, conformably to his wish, he might remain here
by himself. On this he suddenly changed his tone, spoke
civilly, and at length begged for a passage to his native place,
Liberty; but I kept him to his word: we went on board,
and left him alone in this wilderness. This evil-disposed
man, who had formerly been a soldier in the service of the
United States, and was much addicted to drinking, had
exchanged his rifle, on board the Assiniboin, for a considerable
quantity of provisions, a hatchet, brandy, &amp;c., and
thus sufficiently proved his intention of leaving me in this
shameful manner. As he was skilful in the use of the
hatchet, and had a sufficient stock of provisions, it would
be easy for him to make a boat of large poplar stems, and
reach the neighbouring post of Le Roi.</p>

<p>On this day we proceeded twelve or fifteen miles. The
country was flat, and the banks, in some parts, clothed with
fine forests. At sunset we lay-to at a convenient place on
the right bank, where a narrow strip of lofty, verdant wood
filled the space between the river and the steep white hills:
there was an undergrowth of the red willow (<i>Cornus sericea</i>),
which was just coming into flower. The <i>Fringilla Pennsylvanica</i>
was numerous, and fresh tracks of wild animals appeared
in all directions. At twilight a great many of the
whip-poor-wills flew round the fire within three paces of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and quite stunned our ears by their cries. A couple of them
were shot, the first of these birds that I had seen.</p>

<p>On the following morning (the 8th of May), we passed
some extensive sand banks, on which we observed the avoset,
and many wild geese. Towards ten o'clock we reached
the mouth of Vermilion River,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> where many Sioux Indians
were at that time assembled: here commence the lofty forests,
which are peculiar to the banks of the lower Missouri,
and in which the note of the whip-poor-will resounds in
the evening.</p>

<p>I had been informed, on board the steamer, that a man
named Gardner, one of the best pilots on the whole course
of the Missouri, and, at the same time, thoroughly acquainted
with the Indian wilderness from his having been long engaged
in hunting beavers, had gone down the river a short
time before me, and I was advised to overtake him, and,
if possible, to engage him as pilot, as our steersman was
unskilful, and the snags in many parts of the river very
dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> We soon perceived Gardner's miserable flat
leather boat, with a cargo of skins, before us, and presently
overtook it. I immediately offered to take his furs into
my boat, which was more secure, if he would act as steersman,
to which he most readily agreed. His boat was very
unsafe and bad, and at the same time was so heavily laden,
that its edge was scarcely above the water, {462} and it proceeded
very slowly. He was on his return from hunting
beavers on the Upper Yellow Stone, and had two men with
him. We lay-to, and, while the people were transferring
the cargo of Gardner's boat to ours, we made an excursion
into the interesting country. The chain of hills was clothed
with young verdure, and covered and surrounded with tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>trees and forests; beautiful thickets, mixed with cedars,
grew on the banks; all appeared in the fresh loveliness of
spring. In the hollow upper boughs of the lofty, colossal
trees, numbers of the purple swallow (<i>Hirundo purpurea</i>) had
built their nests; flocks of blackbirds were among the high
grass, between the trunks of the trees, where the little wren
(<i>Troglodytes aedon</i>) poured forth its cheerful song; the sparrow-hawk
was sitting at the end of a high branch; and on
the ground, among the roots of the trees, we descried what
we thought was a mouse running along, which, however,
proved to be a little bird; it was too near to be fired at, and
we could not make it rise on its wing. At length, however,
we killed it, and found it to be the pretty little finch called,
by Wilson, <i>Fringilla candacuta</i>. The ash-grey finch (<i>Fringilla
hyemalis</i>), the snow-bird of Wilson, who represents this
bird larger than it is in nature, built its nest here.</p>

<p>Towards one o'clock in the afternoon we reached Le Roi's
plantation, and lay-to at the sand bank opposite to it, the
wind being very high. We dispersed in order to try our
fortune with our fowling-pieces, but found on the bank an
intricate thicket full of burs, so that we could scarcely penetrate
it. Numbers of birds animated this thicket, the cormorant
(<i>Carbo</i>) sat on the tall trees on the bank, the whip-poor-will
uttered its plaintive note, and bats hovered over
the river. We passed the evening sitting round our fire,
when Gardner told us anecdotes of his many adventures
and combats with the Indians. He gave me a particular
account of the death of Glass, the old beaver-hunter whom
I have already mentioned, and which particularly interested
me, because I possessed the scalp of one of the two Arikkara
Indians who were killed by Gardner on account of that
murder. The following were the circumstances of that
event. Old Glass, with two companions, had gone from
Fort Cass to hunt beavers on the Yellow Stone, and, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
were crossing the river on the ice further down, they were
all three shot, scalped, and plundered by a war party of
thirty Arikkaras who were concealed on the opposite bank.
These Indians, who are most dangerous enemies to the
Whites, went then to the sources of Powder River, and it
happened that Gardner, with about twenty men, and thirty
horses, was in the neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> As it was dark when
they were seated about several fires, the Indians suddenly
appeared, addressed them in the Manitari language, surrounded
the fire, and dried their shoes. Gardner, being well
acquainted with the character of the Indians, immediately
took some precautions, which was the more necessary, as
a Manitari woman, who was with his party, told him that
the strangers were Arikkaras. He gradually collected his
people round one of their fires, with their arms in readiness
to act. He was also afraid for his horses, which were scattered
in the prairie, and some of which were actually missing,
and he had already sent some of his men to {463} erect in
the neighbourhood what is called a fort, of trunks of trees,
for the night. The Indians are accustomed, when they intend
to steal horses, suddenly to give a signal, on which they all
jump up, scatter the horses, and drive them away with them.
Gardner, aware of this, watched the enemy closely, and when,
on the signal being given, they all withdrew, three of them
were seized, thrown down and bound. When the Arikkaras
perceived this, several of them came back, pretended
to be innocent of the stealing of the horses, and begged for
their captive comrades; but Gardner declared to them that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>if they did not immediately deliver up all the horses, the
prisoners must die; one of whom, however, had cut the cords
with which he was bound, and escaped. The Indians entreated
for a long time, but were refused. The others seeing
that they must die, commenced their death-song, related
their exploits, and affirmed that they were distinguished
warriors. One of them had old Glass's knife, and his rifle
also had been seen in the possession of these Indians. The
horses, however, were not brought, and the prisoners, alleging
a pressing necessity, were taken aside; but in the
thick copse they attempted to escape, on which one of them
was stabbed, and several shots fired at the other, who was
then killed with the knife. They were both scalped, and
I received one of the scalps as a present, which was unfortunately
lost in the fire on board the steamer. Gardner, by
way of precaution, had all the fires put out, and passed the
night in the fort, which was now completed. They were
not disturbed during the night, and found, in the morning,
that the Indians had retired with their booty, leaving the
prisoners to their fate. The Arikkaras had begged for one
of them in particular, who was a celebrated warrior, and
had even brought back three horses, which they tied up
near at hand, to exchange them for the prisoners; but Gardner
did not attend to their request.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May we reached the mouth of Joway River,
and at three in the afternoon that of Big Sioux.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The heat
was pretty considerable; and we saw the great heron (<i>Ardea
herodias</i>), and a flock of pelicans, some of which were grey,
go up the river. We then came to Floyd's Grave, and at
a bend in the river reached a spot, to the northwest of which
there was a village of the Omahas, of about fifty huts. I
wished much to visit these people, but we could not well stop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>because our provisions were getting low, and we had already
lost too much time through the continued storms. In the
evening we stopped for the night on the left bank opposite
the mouth of Omai Creek.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>On the following morning the weather was fine and warm,
the thermometer at eight o'clock being at 72&deg;. Wood-ducks
in pairs, and flocks of wild geese and pelicans, attracted
our attention, till we reached, about ten o'clock, the beautiful
green hills of Waschinga-Saba's grave,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> where we saw some
deer and wolves, and found the tracks of these animals in
all directions. The rising wind afterwards obliged us to
lay-to, because there was a very dangerous place, with many
snags, just before us; but when the wind abated Gardner
steered my boat very skilfully between the snags. About
sunset we passed the mouth of Little Sioux River, and lay-to
three miles {464} below it, on the opposite bank. On the
11th we were very frequently obliged to stop, and meanwhile
amused ourselves with looking at the beautiful birds in the
thickets. At six o'clock we reached Soldier's River, and
lay-to in a safe bay on the left bank. The weather was
cool on the 12th. When we set out, one of my hunters shot
a cormorant with his rifle. At ten o'clock we passed the
ruins of the old fort of Council Bluffs, and in the afternoon
reached Boyer's Creek, just before which we saw the first
plane tree on the Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> From this spot this species
of tree becomes more and more common as you descend
the river, which is very winding. We landed, between one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>and two o'clock, at Major Pilcher's trading house, formerly
belonging to Mr. Cabann&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Pilcher gave us a very cordial reception after so long
an absence, and we passed the whole day with him. A
lawyer, of the name of Randolph, was at this time here to
investigate a criminal case which had lately occurred; an
<i>engag&eacute;</i> had shot his comrade, as was supposed in cold blood.
There were not many Indians at the trading house at this
time; however, there were some Otos, Missouris, Omahas
and a couple of Joways, and Ongpa or Onpa-Tanga (the
big elk), the principal chief of the Omahas, was daily expected;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
I would gladly have waited to see him, had time
permitted my doing so. Mr. Bodmer took the portraits
of an Omaha and an Oto Indian. These two tribes do not
differ in their manners, dress, and personal appearance.
They wear their hair short, nay, sometimes the head is
completely shorn, except a tuft behind, and in front; the
upper part of the body naked, and strings of wampum
in their ears.</p>

<p>At this time there was more order and cleanliness in Mr.
Pilcher's house than during our former visit, and the store
had been removed into the upper floor. It contained a large
quantity of skins, among which were 24,000 musk-rats,
which are sold at twenty-five cents a piece. The packs of
these latter were very regularly piled up in a square. There
was also a good stock of buffalo and beaver skins. Mr.
Pilcher presented me with a very beautiful skin of a large
dark brown wolf, which had been killed on the upper part
of Boyer's Creek; it is, however, not a species, only a variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner I took an excursion to the neighbouring finely
wooded hills, which were now flourishing in the greatest
luxuriance. Birds of various kinds were very numerous in
a beautiful gently sloping valley, through which the Omahas
pass when they go to their villages. Among the many kinds
of trees and shrubs, I observed crat&aelig;gus, or pyrus, twenty
feet in height, covered with white blossoms, oaks, elms, &amp;c.
Near the house very fine cattle were grazing, and numbers of
swine, all of which roamed at liberty in the woods. There
are extensive plantations of maize and fields of potatoes,
and Mr. Pilcher was so good as to furnish me with a supply
of provisions from his store. This place had likewise been
visited by the cholera in the preceding summer, but it had
not carried off so many persons as at Dougherty's agency
at Belle Vue, because Mr. Pilcher had a better stock of
medicines. At nightfall we took leave of Mr. Pilcher, and
went on board our boat, intending to proceed early the next
morning, the 13th of May. During the night a dog stole
a part of our stock of meat, the {465} door of the cabin not
having been very well secured. Towards eight o'clock we
lay-to on the right bank of the river, at a lovely verdant
prairie covered with thickets and tall insulated trees. There
we found many beautiful birds; among them were numbers
of the red-breasted <i>Fringilla ludoviciana</i>; we shot a good
many of them, but they were so fat that we had considerable
difficulty in preserving the skins. We had a fruitless chase
after some wild turkeys. Towards noon we arrived at Belle
Vue, Major Dougherty's agency,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> which is about thirty-four
miles from Pilcher's trading house, and lies at the foot of
the wooded chain of hills on which Mr. Pilcher's residence
is situated. We landed, but unfortunately found only a few
<i>engag&eacute;s</i>, for Major Dougherty was absent at St. Louis, and
was not expected to return till the middle of July. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>majority of the persons whom we had seen here on our
first visit had died of cholera, during the preceding summer,
seven of ten persons having been carried off in the short
space of twenty-four hours. They had all been buried by
one man, who was now here, and who himself was ill when
he was obliged to perform this last office for the dead.
The disease had, however, quite passed away, and the fort
was now healthy. The environs of Belle Vue presented
great attractions to the naturalist at this season. The richly
wooded hills, with their deep shady ravines and wild glens,
were animated by the cuckoo, and a number of splendid
birds, while innumerable bright winged butterflies fluttered
about over the strawberry blossoms, the magnificent azure
phlox, and a variety of other beautiful flowers.</p>

<p>After we had luxuriated in this romantic spot, we returned
to take in a stock of provisions, and, being refreshed by that
great rarity, a glass of new milk, we continued our journey.
Towards noon we reached the mouth of the river La Platte,
which is about six miles distant from Belle Vue. At sunset
we passed Fife-Barrel Creek, and stopped opposite an island
of the same name on the right bank of the Missouri. As
soon as we landed I set out with my gun in my hand, and,
passing through a lofty avenue of willows, came to a
narrow marsh, quite overgrown with typha. The ground
was swampy, but the raccoons had trod a regular footpath.
The morass was bounded by hills covered with trees and
bushes of the loveliest verdure, enlivened by the baltimore
and the green icteria. The latter incessantly poured forth
its song, which contains a strophe similar to that of the
nightingale. It is remarkable that the cheerfulness and
activity of these birds increase greatly towards evening.
The whip-poor-wills were very numerous in the willow copse
on the bank, and in the evening twilight their notes resounded
on every side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The morning of the 14th opened brightly upon us, and
we set out early and passed Weeping-water River, landing
several times to pursue the wild turkeys, whose note attracted
us to their retreats.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> We often saw these proud birds in the
lofty trees, perched up beyond the reach of small shot. The
most beautiful birds of this country select for their resort
the airy summits of the woods, especially of the fine primeval
forest on the bank, where we lay-to at ten o'clock. This
noble forest comprises all the varied trees of this climate,
with an undergrowth of prickly {466} ash, hazel-bushes,
cornus, &amp;c., entwined with <i>Vitis hederacea</i> and other parasitic
plants. The stems are tall, straight, and closely crowded
together; many were lying on the ground decayed, covered
with moss and lichens, which frequently impeded our progress.
Here we soon shot a variety of birds, and saw some
parrots, which Gardner had already observed on Weeping-water
River. In short we might have found here ample
employment for a long time. A particular species of caterpillar
abounded to such a degree in these forests, that all
the branches of the trees, especially the willows and poplars,
were thickly loaded with them. As soon as we entered
the copses our clothes were covered with these caterpillars
and their webs. We lay-to for the night about a mile below
Little Nemawha Creek, where Dauphin caught a catfish
weighing 15 lbs.</p>

<p>On the 15th we were about five miles from our night's
quarters to the mouth of the Nishnebottoneh, which we
reached at eight o'clock. In the fine forest at this spot our
hunters shot only one rabbit, and wounded a deer, which
we did not obtain. At noon we lay-to on the right bank,
Gardner having promised to look for some wild honey.
I may remark by the way, that though the bee was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
known in America till it was introduced by the Europeans,
it is now spread over the whole continent. The Indians
are said to call it "the white man's fly." It is now common
far up the Missouri, where the honey is eagerly sought for
by both Whites and Indians, who cut it out of the hollow
trunks of the trees. The spot where we rested and prepared
our dinner was below the beautiful verdant wooded hills,
and was shaded by high trees, inhabited by the most brilliant
birds, which afforded much sport to our hunters. Along
the bank and distant hills extended a splendid forest, through
which winded a solitary Indian path, where the grey squirrels
were very numerous. We found much recreation in this
solitary wilderness, but here, too, the caterpillars annoyed
us greatly; they were of a bluish-green colour, with a double
row of green and yellow spots. We afterwards passed the
Grand Nemawha, and lay-to, for the night, opposite Solomon's
Island, six miles above Wolf River.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>On the 16th of May the river was covered with a thick
fog, which prevented our proceeding on our voyage as early
as usual. At half-past seven o'clock we were opposite the
mouth of Wolf River, where we saw a herd of six or seven
deer, and lay-to at nine o'clock on the right bank. The
lofty forest here had a thick undergrowth of box-alder and
cornus, which was completely covered with caterpillars and
their webs. At noon we reached Nodaway River, and were
charmed with the prospect of the sublime forest scenery of
the banks, and the picturesque islands in this river.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Luxuriant
woods appeared on every side, covered to the summits
of their highest branches with graceful light green climbing
plants, so that the trunks looked like verdant columns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Their foliage was shining and juicy, like the whole of the
luxuriant vegetation that surrounded them. Even from
our boat we could see, in the dark forest, the scarlet plumage
of the beautiful red tanagra, which the French on the Mississippi
call the pope, the splendid cardinal, and the bright
red baltimore. The meridian sun shed a glorious effulgence
over this magnificent scene; where, {467} however, the red-bud,
and the other early blossoming trees, had already lost
their flowers. Most of the trees of these forests on the lower
Missouri have not the beautiful large flowers common to
those of Brazil, but, with a few exceptions, have only catkins.
For the first time after a long interval we saw the kingfisher
on the bank. Towards four o'clock in the afternoon we
reached the beautiful chain of the Black Snake Hills, and,
not long after, Roubedoux's trading house in the neighbourhood
of the Joways and Saukies, or Sacs.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The forest-covered
hills, as well as the prairie stretched at their foot,
were now adorned with the most lovely verdure. The two
houses at this spot were painted white, which, when seen
from the river, gave them a very picturesque appearance
amid the surrounding green. Behind the dwelling houses
were extensive fields of maize, protected by fences, and very
fine cattle were grazing in the plain. Mr. Roubedoux, the
owner of the house, and his son, were from home, and some
ignorant <i>engag&eacute;s</i> could not comply with my desire to obtain
fresh provisions, and to pay a visit to the Indians in the
vicinity, to accomplish which I requested them to provide
me with horses. About thirty Oto and Missouri Indians
had been here a couple of days, and had just gone to the
neighbouring Indians to purchase brandy. About six miles
from hence lies a village of the Joway Indians, and at about
the same distance down the Missouri, one of the Saukies.
These Indians are able to obtain as much brandy as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>please at the extreme settlements of the Americans, about
fifteen miles from this place, who, at their own risk, pass
the limit of the Indian country, fixed by the government
in the latitude of the Cantonment of Leavenworth. This
great facility of procuring cheap and bad spirits is extremely
ruinous to the Indians, and accelerates the destruction of
their race. We were dissuaded from visiting these two
Indian tribes, because they had, for several days, been
indulging in the immoderate use of whisky, and were in a
dangerous state of excitement. A great number of Oto Indians
gradually assembled near Roubedoux's house: many
of them were quite intoxicated, and nearly all had four or
five casks of this fatal draught fastened to their horses.</p>

<p>The Oto, Missouri, and Joway Indians, at least the young
people, had their hair shorn in the manner of the Saukies
and Foxes: several, however, especially the elder men, wore
their hair short in the neck. I saw one of the Missouris
with his hair hanging half-way down his back. Their dress
and customs are said not to differ from the Saukies. They
had holes in their ears, in which they wore bunches of wampum:
some young men had red cloth tied round their heads,
and one of them wore a cap made of the entire skin of a
bear's head, with the ears, which gave him a very grotesque
appearance. All these Indians were weaker, and of lower
stature, than those of the upper Missouri, especially the
Manitaries, Mandans, and Crows. The Otos and Missouris
intended to go to-day with their stock of whisky to their
villages on the other side of the river, and wished us to set
them over, to which, however, I was not disposed to accede.
Mr. Bodmer took the portrait of an athletic Missouri youth.
This tribe was formerly numerous and {468} powerful, but,
being defeated by the Foxes, Saukies, and Osages, it lost
its independence, and the few that remain have intermingled
with the Otos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>We made some little excursions in the neighbourhood,
and found in the prairie and the lofty trees many beautiful
plants and fine birds; the day was hot, and the evening
remarkably pleasant; a numerous company of Indians, who
were not a little troublesome, visited us in our boat, and
stopped till ten o'clock. We left our night's quarters early
on the following day, the 17th, and proceeded down the river,
the banks of which were clothed with tall forests. The thermometer
at noon was at 75&deg;, but the wind was high, and
compelled us to lay-to; we therefore took advantage of the
delay to go ashore, and make some addition to our collection
of plants and birds. About four in the afternoon, though
the wind was still high, we were enabled to pursue our course.
We were not long in making Cow Island, about nine miles
from Leavenworth, where a good deal of cattle belonging
to the military post were grazing. A little before sunset we
came to the isolated dwelling of a white man, and saw several
Indians, there being a settlement of the Kickapoos, who were
removed from the eastern provinces, at a short distance from
the river. We lay-to for the night on the right bank, and
several of my people went on before us to Leavenworth.
On the 18th, during a heavy rain, we made the three miles
to the post; we heard some musket-shot, a signal that the
guard was relieved, and soon reached the landing-place of
the Cantonment. The sentinel informed us that we must
immediately appear before the commanding officer, and compelled
us, in an imperious manner, to keep close and march
before him. We arrived like prisoners at the house of the
commander, where Major Ryley received us with tolerable
politeness, and supplied me with the provisions, meat, bread,
&amp;c., which I required, taking care, however, to be well paid
for them.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cantonment of Leavenworth is pleasantly situated;
ten or twelve neat and spacious buildings, surrounded with
a gallery or verandah, are occupied by two companies of
the 6th regiment, not more than eighty men, with ten
officers, who were detached from Jefferson Barracks, near
St. Louis. Dr. Fellowes, the military physician, who in
the preceding year travelled with us to this place, received
me with much cordiality, and gave me a good deal of information
respecting this interesting country. He had been
very successful with his cholera patients, for, out of a great
number, one only had died, because he always attacked
the disorder at its very commencement.</p>

<p>The heavy rain had converted the surrounding country
into a swamp, so that we could not conveniently visit the
environs of the Cantonment. The soil is very fruitful, and
the whole country clothed in rich verdure. About four miles
from this place, down the river, the Indian line meets the
Missouri at right angles; this is the frontier of the Indian
territory, which the Cantonment is destined to protect. Near
this post is the village of the Kickapoos, inhabited by a poor
and rather degenerated race. Major Morgan,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> who kept
a large store of provisions and other {469} necessaries, had
a share in Gardner's fur trade; the latter accordingly quitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>me at this place. To celebrate his happy return the people
drank rather too freely, and were endeavouring to make
Descoteaux do the same, in order to induce him to sell his
beaver skins below their value, but I would not suffer this,
and took him with me. The people here have a sufficient
number of cattle and swine, as well as plenty of milk, butter,
and cheese. My collections were here enriched with many
interesting specimens. Dr. Fellowes had the kindness to
give me a goffer (a large field-mouse), undoubtedly <i>Diplostoma
bulbivorum</i>. Unfortunately the specimen was not complete.</p>

Maximilian been able to visit this region, he might have antedated the discoveries
made by J. V. Hayden and F. B. Meek, which awakened much interest in the
scientific world. This area, extending nearly five hundred miles in each direction,
lies between Cheyenne and White rivers east of the Black Hills. It is a tertiary
formation of indurated sands, clays, and marl, cut up into ravines and ca&ntilde;ons
by streams and climatic action. In certain places it takes on the form of a gigantic
city in ruins. To the scientist, however, the chief interest is its fossils, immense
numbers of which are imbedded in the formation. The first descriptive account
was that of Dr. H. A. Prout, who visited the region in 1847, given in the <i>American
Journal of Science</i>, iii, 2d series, pp. 248-250. Two years later, Dr. John Evans
went through this district, and the next year it was visited by Thaddeus A. Culbertson
in the interest of the Smithsonian Institution. A thorough examination was made
in 1853 by J. V. Hayden and F. B. Meek; the former passed through again in 1857,
the results being embodied in American Philosophical Society <i>Transactions</i>, xii,
new series (Phila., 1863). The fossil remains were described by Professor Joseph
Leidy in <i>Contributions to Extinct Vertebr&aelig; Fauna</i> (Washington, 1873). Hayden
made still another visit to this region in 1866, the results of which were published
in his <i>Geographical and Geological Survey of the Territories</i>. The White River
Bad Lands are still difficult of access, and not as yet visited by tourists.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

boundary of Missouri, consisted of a line running directly north and south
through the middle of the channel of the mouth of Kansas River. In 1824 commissioners
were appointed to survey the western and southern line of Missouri,
and in 1830 this was adopted as the boundary of the Western Territory (see our
volume xxi (Wyeth), p. 50, note 31). This boundary is, however, nearly thirty
miles (by the river) below Fort Leavenworth. Probably Maximilian confused this
with the boundary of Fort Leavenworth military reservation.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

VOYAGE FROM THE CANTONMENT OF LEAVENWORTH TO PORTSMOUTH,
ON THE MOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER, FROM
MAY 18TH TO JUNE 20TH</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Little Platte River&mdash;William's Ferry&mdash;The Mormons, a Religious
Sect&mdash;St. Charles&mdash;Land Journey to St. Louis&mdash;Residence there&mdash;The
Indian Barrows&mdash;Mouth of the Ohio&mdash;New Harmony&mdash;Journey

<p>On the afternoon of the 18th of May, I left the Cantonment
of Leavenworth amid a very heavy rain, which continuing
on the 19th I lay-to, and made my people light a
fire on shore, to warm themselves, and dry their clothes.
As soon as we had left Little Platte River, I observed numerous
isolated settlements, from which others had taken their
rise. At Portage l'Independence, I saw Mr. Soublette, who
had been ill for some time.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> As I had very recently visited
his trading post on the upper Missouri, I was enabled to
give him the most recent intelligence respecting it. He has
always been engaged in the fur trade; in the first instance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>in opposition to the American Fur Company; subsequently,
however, in connection with it; he was now waiting for the
steam-boat, Oto,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> intending to go by it to St. Louis.</p>

<p>About five o'clock we reached the landing-place of Liberty,
but I did not make any stay there. Descoteaux here fell in
with one of his acquaintances, a Canadian beaver hunter,
and begged permission to leave me; I did not wish to detain
the man, and accordingly set him on shore with all his
furs and skins. At nightfall we came to a settlement called
William's Ferry, or Charaton-Scatty; here, on the northern
bank, we lay-to for the night, under shelter of a lofty umbrageous
forest.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> We passed the 20th on the same spot,
our boat having received some injury, and we accordingly
had it repaired; at the same time we caused our effects to
be dried, as they had been thoroughly drenched by the
rain.</p>

<p>We met with a friendly reception in a house near the
landing-place, where the mistress sold us poultry, buttermilk,
&amp;c., for which she at first declined accepting any
payment. The {471} whole country in the valleys, as well
as on the mountains, was covered with a lofty shady forest
of magnificent trees, of every variety common to this climate,
which, being refreshed by the late rains, were clad in the
most brilliant verdure. The splendid plumage of the bright
red baltimore, and the vermilion tanagra (<i>Tanagra rubra</i>)
was very striking, amidst the dark foliage of the forest; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>latter is here called the flax-bird, from its feeding on the
buds of that plant. We listened with pleasure to the note
of the cuckoo, which much resembles that of the European
bird. We heard frogs and tree-frogs in the vicinity, and
the whistle of some animal exactly like that of our yellow-striped
salamander, and doubtless one of that family,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> under
the fallen trunks of the trees. I was much surprised, during
these travels in North America, to meet with so few animals
of the lizard kind, whereas tortoises were very numerous.</p>

<p>There was only a single path along the bank from one
plantation to another; all else was covered with a thick
forest. There were wild, lonely valleys, with colossal tulip
trees, and an undergrowth of papaw, which was now in
flower; a carpet of ferns was spread on the ground in the
dark shade, where a small clear stream meandered among
the grasses and other plants. The dwellings of a few planters
were scattered on the hills. In this wild and romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
valley I saw but few birds; and, in general, I remarked, in
these woods on the Missouri, that far more birds lived in
the vicinity of the plantations than in the recesses of the
forest, an observation which is confirmed by McKenney,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
and of which I have spoken in my travels in Brazil. We
saw no mammalia in these woods, though there are many
squirrels; the number of which, however, must have greatly
decreased if what Bradbury says is true, that 2,000 of them
had been shot in one hunting excursion.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> I unwillingly
left a spot so interesting to the naturalist, especially as I
had no agreeable conversation to expect on board the boat.
My live bears attracted all the inhabitants {472} in the
neighbourhood; nay, the people here were more eager to
see the much-dreaded grizzly bears than even in Europe.</p>

<p>Our vessel was crowded with curious persons, and, besides
these, an unwelcome intruder had intoxicated the greater
part of my people. Among our inquisitive visitors there
were several men belonging to a religious sect known here
by the name of Mormons. They complained bitterly of
the unjust treatment which they had lately experienced.
They had lived on the other side of the Missouri, and, as
they asserted, had been expelled, on account of their doctrines,
by the neighbouring planters, their dwellings demolished
and burnt, their plantations destroyed, and some of them
killed, on which they settled on the north bank of the river.
I was not able to learn whether all this was true, or why,
after an interval of one or two years, they have not obtained
redress from the government. So much, however, is certain,
that, if these people spoke the truth, it would be a great disgrace
to the administration of justice in this country, which
calls itself the only free country in the world.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>According to their account, an angel appeared in 1821
to the founder of their doctrine, and brought him golden
tables of law, on which the contents of a certain chapter
of the Bible were engraved, and which is the substance of
the doctrine. The inscription was translated, and the angel
took the tables away. They spoke also of a prophet Mormon,
but I was not able clearly to comprehend the mystical
meaning of their words.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> A sensible old man gave me
some notion of their doctrine, to which he seemed to be
much devoted. He affirmed that their sect was perfectly
harmless, and never molested others, a point respecting which
their neighbours might, perhaps, give a different testimony.</p>

<p>These backwoodsmen were much interested by all our
effects, and were particularly struck with our percussion
guns and rifles. In those parts where the woods have been
cleared, the country which they inhabit is extremely fertile.
Deer and wild turkeys are still met with; but bears are not
numerous, and the panther is only now and then seen. The
elk (<i>Cervus Canadensis</i>) has been long since extirpated.
The wood-rat (<i>Neotoma?</i>) is not uncommon; it does mischief
to the fruits, and gets into the so-called smoke-houses,
where meat is smoked and dried. The common grey wolf
is said to be very numerous: the black race is seldom seen
here, and the white never, which is a proof that it is a distinct
species.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 21st of May we passed Fire Prairie and the mouth
of Fishing Creek,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and again saw magnificent forests, the
trees of which were so lofty that our guns were unable to
reach the birds perched on the upper branches. The
ground was covered with flowers, among which was a
beautiful sky-blue iris, and with an undergrowth of papaw
trees, above which arose the tall forest trees, such as the
<i>Gleditschia triacanthos</i>, sassafras, tulip trees, &amp;c., entwined
with the <i>Vitis hederacea</i>. The red tanagra shone like a
glowing coal amid the dark forest.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 22nd of May, we met the Joway
steamer, which could with difficulty {473} proceed up the
shallow river. Old Roubedoux, who was on board, brought
news from St. Louis. He had purchased from the Fur Company,
for 500 dollars, the trading house on the Black Snake
Hills, from which we had just come.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Having halted near
the steam-boat at noon, with a temperature of 89&deg;, we made
a short excursion into the wood, where I procured the beautiful
red adder, <i>Coluber coccineus</i>. The colour of its exquisitely
marked body is a brownish vermilion, and, therefore,
not so purely vermilion as the splendid coral adder of Brazil.
The forest was so full of the caterpillars which have been
already mentioned, that walking through it was most disagreeable.
At five in the afternoon we passed Grand River,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
and lay-to for the night six miles further down, on the south
bank, at a plantation, the friendly inmates of which, though
very well disposed, could give us only a small supply of
provisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 23rd, in the neighbourhood of Little Arrow Rock,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
we saw some persons catching an immensely large white
catfish, the weight of which must have been very great,
but I was not able to stop and examine it. At this place
we heard a strange noise under the boat, which my people
affirmed was produced by the prickly fins of the fish called
by them casburgot, or malacigan (<i>Catastomus carpio</i>, Les.),
and by the Americans, buffalo-fish. It weighs from five
to six pounds. Towards evening we passed Franklin, and
stopped at Boonville.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Two negro slaves, who were returning
from the plantations, were very much astonished at
the sight of my bears: one of them had a long tin speaking-trumpet,
with which these men, when working in the forest,
are called together. It may not be irrelevant to remark
that all the negroes of these parts are slaves. Fine tall trees
covered the hills on the bank, which my people ascended
in order to purchase provisions in the scattered dwellings
of the planters.</p>

<p>On the 24th we passed the small town of Columbia, below
the mouth of the Manitu stream, where a quantity of logs
of wood, for the use of the steam-boats, was piled up on
the bank. At noon the thermometer was at 90&deg;. An uninterrupted
forest, with beautiful scenery, adorned the canal
during the entire extent of this day's voyage. Having passed
the village of Maryanne, on the northern side, we reached
Jefferson City at six in the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This place is still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>in its infancy and most of the habitations are scattered,
while the ground between them is not yet levelled. It is
covered with heaps of stones and high weeds; and cows
and pigs were roaming about at liberty. We could not obtain
any provisions except salt pork, biscuits, and whisky.
In the bookseller's shop, as it is termed, we only found a
few school books. In the evening I proceeded to the plantation
of a person named Ramsay,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> where a number of
negroes congregated about our boat, from whom I was fortunate
enough to purchase some poultry. These people
were dressed in all sorts of left-off clothes, and forcibly reminded
me of similar scenes in Brazil.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 25th, we passed
C&ocirc;te sans Dessein; and at noon, when the thermometer was
at 88&deg;, reached the little town of Portland, which was founded
about two years since. Near the mouth of Gasconade River
we met the Oto steam-boat.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> We stopped {474} for the
night below the Rivi&egrave;re &agrave; Berger, and on the morning of
the 26th lay-to at the settlement of a man named Porter,
to which the name of Washington has been given, though
at present it consists of only a few isolated dwellings: the
inhabitants were very courteous and obliging.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The adjacent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>forest was animated by many interesting birds; and
I here purchased a live young bear. Opposite to this place,
four or five miles up the country, a Mr. Von Mertels, of
Hanover, has settled; and here, a few years since, Dr. Duden
resided, who has written on North America, and who is
still much talked of in this country.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> In the evening we
reached St. Charles, to which great numbers of German
emigrants now resort,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and lay-to at the settlement of Mr.
Chauvin, who keeps an inn, and has set up a stage between
this and St. Louis. Here we passed the night, but the rain
was so heavy, that we were prevented leaving the house.
The people spoke to us a great deal of the many persons
who had fallen victims to the cholera the year before. There
is a ferry at this place over the Missouri, in which the large
wheel is set in motion by six horses.</p>

<p>On the 27th, after the rain had ceased, we went by land
to St. Louis: the weather was warm and damp, and the
brilliant humming-birds fluttered about the plants in the
court-yard of the house. As the stage did not run to-day,
I hired a long, open, farmer's wagon, with three horses, in
order to reach the Mississippi as speedily as possible, while
Dreidoppel was to go by water, with my collections, &amp;c.
We immediately entered the forest, where colossal trees,
especially the sugar maple, oak, elm, &amp;c., covered a hilly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>ground, overgrown with many interesting plants, about which
the most beautiful butterflies peculiar to this country were
hovering. From time to time we saw planters' dwellings
all built of wood, covered with planks, and roofed with
shingles, the chimneys being of brick. Among the many
species of trees is the black oak, which is used for dyeing
and tanning. A great quantity of the bark is sent to England.
The forest extends many miles, and, becoming gradually
thinner, is succeeded by the open prairie, which does
not differ from the prairies of the west, especially of the
upper Missouri. We stopped at an isolated inn to refresh
our horses, and were still six or seven miles from St. Louis.
The last part of the road lay through a wood of dark green
oaks, in which I saw many circular pools of water, which
undoubtedly owed their origin to the sinking of the earth,
of which Mr. Say speaks, in the account of Major Long's
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> These pools are fifty or sixty paces in diameter,
and are inhabited by numerous frogs, whose croaking is
heard at a great distance. At noon we alighted at the Union
Hotel in St. Louis, after an absence of above a year.</p>

<p>St. Louis was now healthy, and not suffering from the
cholera, as we had expected; there had, however, been a
couple of cases in a steamer from New Orleans. No change
of consequence had taken place since our last visit. At the
factory of the American Fur Company I found very agreeable
letters from Europe. Here I saw Mr. Lamont, to whose
amiable family we were introduced, but I greatly regretted
the absence of General Clarke.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> We received much {475}
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>kindness in the house of Major O'Fallan, who is perfectly
acquainted with the Missouri, and the aboriginal inhabitants.
Here we saw a collection of Indian portraits and
scenery by Mr. Catlin, a painter from New York, of which
we were able to form an opinion after our recent travels in
the country.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Major Dougherty, our friend and travelling
companion, had the goodness to give us a night's lodging,
and we were highly gratified by his conversation about the
countries which we had just left, and with which he is well
acquainted.</p>

<p>Among the remarkable objects in the vicinity of St. Louis
are the ancient Indian barrows, the traces of which I had
hitherto in vain attempted to find on the whole course of
the Missouri. In order to take a view of them, we crossed
the Missouri in a steam-ferry, where there is room for the
horses and carriage, and in the upper story of its pavilion,
a light, airy chamber. On the opposite bank are a good
many houses, inns, and shops, under the shade of lofty old
trees. Fish, turtles, vegetables, and other provisions, are
daily sent from this place to the market in the town. The
surrounding country is level, sandy, and, in part, marshy;
the road passes alternately through open meadows and copses
to the skirts of an extensive verdant plain, or prairie, after
we had crossed a wooden bridge thrown over the pretty
stream called Kahokia Creek, the banks of which are picturesquely
bordered with fine trees.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The colour of the water
is dark brown, like many forest streams in Brazil, and forms
a beautiful camera obscura. The open plain, which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>now reached, was everywhere clothed with young grass,
and in several spots with low bushes. As soon as we had
passed the skirts of the forest on the Mississippi, a long row
of very flat ancient Indian barrows came in sight, extending
parallel with the river, and a second row, forming an angle
with the first, in which some of the barrows are higher than
others. Right in front of the angle formed by the two rows
is the most considerable barrow of all, which does not appear
at first sight, though it is at least sixty feet high. It is
called Trappist's or Monk's Hill, because some French
monks of the order of La Trappe formerly lived here.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
I may remark by the way, that many settlers of French
origin live in this part of the country.</p>

<p>We proceeded in the direction of the above hill, which is
about six miles from the river; it is covered with greensward
and a few old trees, and some new wooden buildings are
erected on it. In the prairie stood a group of very tall
poplars, under which a herd of cattle was reposing. Here
we left our wagon, but the bull, who seemed to be lord and
master, was at first much inclined to oppose our passage.
Numerous birds of many species and beautiful butterflies
were fluttering about in the ardent noontide sun. The Indian
hills, or barrows, of which Say counted seventy-five,
have a very striking appearance; they stand in a row, generally
isolated, but sometimes two are side by side. Some
of them still retain their conical form, while others are very
much flattened. There are similar barrows near St. Louis
on the other side of the Mississippi, most of which have,
however, been destroyed by cultivation and building. The
destination and the origin of these remarkable barrows and
walls, which have been the subject of so much discussion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
{476} are still involved in obscurity; while the government
of the United States alone might have collected the necessary
materials on the subject, if it had employed competent persons
to excavate, carefully to examine, survey, and describe
all the monuments of this kind that are scattered over the
states of the Union.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Even at this time, it is not wholly too
late to do much towards the accomplishment of so interesting
an inquiry; not a moment should, however, be lost.
Baron Alexander Von Humboldt has given an interesting
essay on the subject in his valuable works; and several
American writers have collected and published many particulars
respecting these remains. Of some of them Warden
has given ground plans and sketches, but no favourable
result can be expected till the excavation is prosecuted in
earnest.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Perhaps the flint knives resembling those of
Mexico<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> might be found near St. Louis. These barrows
have a close resemblance to the ancient German barrows
which are everywhere found in our forests. A late traveller
(Dr. De Wette) conjectures that the American barrows are
not produced by art, but by nature, because there is no fosse
round them from which the earth was taken; this notion
is, however, very easily refuted, as the barrows and walls
are arranged in regular figures and lines, and in like manner
no fosse or excavation is to be seen round the barrows
in the German forests. The earth was taken from the surface
in the neighbourhood, but it was by no means necessary
on that account to excavate a fosse. With regard to
the regular position of the barrows of St. Louis, they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>in this respect a close resemblance to the kurghans of the
Russian steppes, which also lie in long regular lines. The
very form, too, of both seems to be quite similar, if we except
the stone images which are often seen on the kurghans.
Pallas, in his "Tour through Southern Russia" (Vol. I.
Vig. 1), gives a sketch of a row of barrows which perfectly
resemble those of St. Louis.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>A pleasant westerly breeze which sprung up, was a great
relief to us in the sultry heat, and continued till we returned
to the shady forests on Kahokia Creek, which we reached
at two o'clock. Numerous tortoises live in this stream.
The banks of the Mississippi, near St. Louis, are likewise
remarkable for various impressions of shells and zoophytes
in the limestone; among them are the beautiful crinoides,
which are found in great perfection close to the buildings
of the town. Mr. Lesueur has collected and sent to France
specimens of all these fossil remains, and every information
on the subject is contained in his and other similar works.
I neglected, while I was at St. Louis, to see the tame buffaloes
which Mr. Pi&egrave;rre Chouteau kept on his estate near the
town, though I should have been very glad, for many reasons,
to have seen these animals in a domestic state. I have been
frequently told, in America, of hybrids of the buffalo (bison)
and the tame race, but never saw any; and several naturalists,
especially Mr. Thomas Say,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> have {477} always affirmed
that no instance ever occurred of hybrids, capable of propagating
their kind, of that animal and the tame species.
He declares that every case into which he examined turned
out to be unproved. Mr. Gallatin has, indeed, lately spoken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>on the subject, and pronounced against Mr. Say's opinion.
He calls the bison a mere variety of the common ox; but
this may be easily refuted.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The bison is quite a different
species from the ox, as is clear, not only from its outward
form, high withers, short tail, the formation of the head,
and the peculiarity of its long hair, but likewise from
the osteology, the number of the ribs and vertebr&aelig; being
different in the two animals.</p>

<p>There is another point on which I differ from Mr. Gallatin,
namely, his denial of the great decrease in the number
of buffaloes in general. For when we consider how far
these animals have been driven up the country, and that, in
these very parts, they are even less numerous than formerly,
we have a fact which at once proves a great decrease, of
which nobody in the interior of the country can entertain
a doubt.</p>

<p>After staying about a week we took leave of our friends
at St. Louis, and embarked on board the Metamore steam-boat,
which left on the 3rd of June. Messrs. Chouteau,
Lamont, General Pratte, and Ortley, accompanied me on
board, where we bade each other farewell.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> We glided
rapidly down the Mississippi, and passed Chester before
evening, but were soon obliged to lay-to, because we were
apprehensive that the night would be dark.</p>

<p>Our voyage on the 4th of June was extremely pleasant;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>the forests on the Mississippi were clothed in the brightest
verdure, climbing plants interlaced the tall trees, and the
papaw was in greater luxuriance than I have anywhere seen;
but here, too, the caterpillars had partly stripped the bushes.
Towards nine in the morning, after the early vapours were
dispelled, we reached the mouth of the Ohio, the clear green
water of which contrasted strongly with the grey and muddy
stream of the Mississippi. We stopped at the landing-place
at the junction of the two rivers, to wait for the steamer
expected from New Orleans, and to take on board some
of its passengers. The Ohio is at this time too shallow for
the large Mississippi steam-boats to ascend it, and they,
therefore, transfer their passengers to the smaller boats from
St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Pittsburg, which, in
the present instance, occasioned us a most unpleasant delay.
The Boonslick, a large boat from New Orleans, lay
aground in the Mississippi, waiting to be relieved.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> We
therefore proceeded to her with a flat boat, by the aid of
which she was lightened of a part of her cargo, consisting
of lead. This business detained our Metamore a considerable
time, after which we returned to the landing-place: we
made use of this delay to undertake an excursion into the
forest which borders upon the town. <i>Papilio Ajax</i> and
<i>Turnus</i> were very numerous, and we caught a great many,
especially of the former. In the shade of the forest we found
the red Mississippi tanagra, which I had not before seen
on my whole journey; and, likewise, observed its nest, which
did not seem to annoy the birds. The beautiful baltimore
and many {478} other interesting birds were likewise frequent.
At three o'clock the boat's bell summoned the scattered
party to return. Two large New Orleans steam-boats,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>the Mediterranean and the Chester, now arrived. The former,
which is the largest on the Mississippi, and about the size
of a frigate, only much higher, came along side our vessel.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
It had several cholera patients on board, and two persons
had died of that disorder during the voyage. It was by no
means pleasant to us to be obliged to receive passengers
from this boat; nevertheless we took a good number of them
on board higher up the river, at Smithland, whither this
large boat was able to accompany us. In the evening we
arrived at the village of Paduca, where we passed the night;
and at noon the following day (the 5th of June) reached
Smithland at the mouth of Cumberland River, where we
stopped no longer than was necessary to receive the passengers
from the Mediterranean; after which we proceeded on
our voyage, in calm, hot weather, up the Ohio, which appeared
in all its beauty, passed Cave-in-Rock,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> continued
our voyage during the night, and early in the morning of
the 6th of June reached Mount Vernon, where we quitted
the steamer. We then procured a carriage (dearborn), and
pursued our journey to Harmony by land.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>This road, which I have already described, was extremely
pleasant, on account of the luxuriant foliage of the lofty
forest, though the trees, especially the beeches, had in many
places suffered from the frost. The finest tulip, storax, and
sassafras, with many other kinds, spread a cool shade, while
innumerable butterflies afforded us much entertainment.
The ajax, the blue and black philenor, the yellow and black
turnus, &amp;c., were countless. Our driver frequently alighted
from his seat to shoot with his rifle some grey squirrels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>which are here very common, for dinner. About noon we
had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Say and our other friends
at Harmony, in good health. I here became acquainted
with Mr. Robert Dale Owen,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> a very well informed man,
and derived much instruction and gratification from my
conversation with Messrs. Say, Lesueur, Owen, Macklure,
Twigg, &amp;c., by whom we were most kindly received.</p>

<p>On the 9th of June, after taking leave of our friends, I
left New Harmony, with Mr. Lesueur, to continue our
journey by way of Vincennes, to which place Mr. Twigg
accompanied us on horseback.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The whole country through which we passed, except near
Vincennes, close to the Wabash, is an uninterrupted forest,
in which the dwellings of the settlers or backwoodsmen lie
scattered on both sides of the wood. They are, as I have
already described them, for the chief part, block-houses, &amp;c.
and only here and there is a brick building to be seen. The
fields are everywhere surrounded with fences. The country
soon becomes hilly, and the soil in the vicinity of the Wabash
is very fertile. The heat and dust were excessively annoying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>in this dry season; however, fresh, cool water was everywhere
to be found, each dwelling-house being usually supplied
with a well. A stranger is much struck with the dress of
the women, living in small, wretched cottages, where he not
unfrequently sees, if not a lady in fashionable {479} attire,
yet in a style of dress which, in Europe, he would neither
look for nor see in habitations far superior. In these little
cages there are immense four-post bedsteads, which occupy
nearly the whole of the small chamber, which, like the cobbler's
stall, "serves for bedroom, parlour, kitchen, and all."
The door and windows of these hovels are generally open.
Though the weather was particularly dry this spring, the
corn looked very well; the soil of the forest is everywhere a
very rich black mould, except in one place, where, for a
couple of miles, sand suddenly appears. Mr. Lesueur, who
has often visited and examined this part of the country,
directed my attention to the entire change of vegetation.
Instead of the many kinds of lofty trees in the forests of
Indiana, we find, in this sandy tract, the low, black oak,
which is not above thirty or forty feet high; as soon as that
is passed the tall trees again appear. Here the fallen trunks
give a wild and romantic appearance to the forest, where
great numbers of cattle and swine were feeding. We here
saw a place where the inhabitants of the neighbourhood
assemble for religious exercises, which are called camp meetings.
These singular assemblies have been described by
many travellers, and Mrs. Trollope does not appear to have
exaggerated in her account of them.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> We observed vestiges
of huts, fireplaces, and the eminences fenced round, which
serve as pulpits, from which their spiritual teachers preach.
We stopped, at noon, at a small village in the wood, consisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>of only five or six houses, which is called Owensville.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Close to the cottage where we dined was a large clover field,
in which innumerable butterflies, especially ajax and philenor,
were fluttering. Volney observes, that he travelled
through the extensive forest, from Louisville to Vincennes,
in the month of July, without seeing a single settlement, or
hearing the song of a bird.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The first part of this sentence
is no longer applicable; but I can confirm the latter, for
which many authorities might be quoted.</p>

<p>Before evening we reached Prince Town, which is built
with a large square in the centre.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> We passed the night in
a good inn, where, as is common in this country, a sort of
punca was suspended over the table in the dining-room;
this was drawn backwards and forwards by a negro, and
served at once to cool the air, and to chase away the swarms
of troublesome flies. On the following day we passed
through lofty and more thickly-wooded forests than yesterday,
consisting in many places of old beeches which had
suffered much from the frost: indeed, both the fruit and
mast were destroyed completely by the frost in this part of
the country. The catalpa was in full blossom, but, though
the ground was covered with a luxuriant growth of plants,
none of them were yet in flower. We saw numbers of the
grey squirrel, which was served up to us in the inn as a
delicacy. Beautifully romantic little valleys intersect the
tall and gloomy forest, where we now and then met some
farmers, whose wives were all on horseback, smoking their
pipes. After taking some dinner at an isolated saw-mill in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>the wood, we reached, three miles further off, the White
River, in a fertile valley, where the heat was very oppressive,
because the {480} forest completely impeded any circulation
of air. The wild vine flourishes here in great luxuriance,
the soil being very rich.</p>

<p>The White River is a fine stream, rather narrower at this
place than the Wabash, and there is a ferry to cross over
to the other side.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> There the face of the country is considerably
changed, for, the soil being sandy, the vegetation
of the sand and prairies of St. Louis again recurs. It is
worthy of remark, that all the plants in the sandy soil were
now in flower, whereas in the rich black mould of the forest
none were yet in blossom.</p>

<p>When the rather hilly country on the White River was
passed, it became flatter, and we at length issued from the
forest into the verdant plain of the Wabash, in which Vincennes
is situated, at the distance of twelve miles from the
White River. As we approached Vincennes, we observed,
on the right hand, a hill covered with oak bushes, called
Warrior's Hill, from which the Americans observed the
enemy when they took this place from the English.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Vincennes is one of the most ancient settlements of the
French, founded in 1736. There was formerly a fort here,
belonging to the series of posts by which a communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>was kept up in this wilderness. It was subsequently called
Old Post, and is said to have received its present name from
a Captain Vincennes, who possessed the confidence of the
Indians, and to whom they presented a piece of land.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
It is now a mean-looking, scattered place, consisting of several
unpaved streets, on the bank of the Wabash. Many
old buildings are still to be seen, remaining from the time
in which so many French settlements were founded in the
west. Most of the houses built at that time are small, and
have only one story; which is likewise the case at Vincennes,
but the Americans have, however, erected many new brick
buildings. The court-house, standing at the verge of the
prairie, is, as usual, a square edifice, covered with white
plaster. The descendants of the French, of whom there
are many families, do not belong to the better class of the
inhabitants, but are low, ignorant, and superstitious. The
place is, however, thriving, and promises to possess, in time,
a considerable trade. Many Americans have settled in it,
and some of them have well furnished shops: but a bookseller
who set up a shop there met with no encouragement
whatever, and was obliged to leave.</p>

<p>In front of the house of the former governor, which stands in
a pleasant open spot near the river, are some ancient shady
trees, and a garden, containing many rare and beautiful
plants, is attached to it; formerly it was kept in good order,
but it is now sadly neglected and suffered to run to ruin.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>We put up, in Vincennes, at Clarke's Hotel, where the
stages start from; and I intended to proceed on my journey
the following day, but the landlord and postmaster declared,
rather laconically, that I must wait for the next opportunity,
because our baggage was too heavy. This caused a delay
of two days, which I endeavoured, in Mr. Lesueur's company,
to turn to the best {481} account. Mr. Badolet, of Geneva,
who has long resided at this place, and is thoroughly acquainted
with the country, was unfortunately indisposed.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
He takes much interest in the promotion of knowledge, and
through his instrumentality a library has been formed, which,
though still in its infancy, consists of about 1500 volumes.
New books are added every year, and there are already some
valuable works. Mr. Badolet likewise purchased the well
preserved lower jaw of a mastodon, which was found in the
White River. Mr. Lesueur made a drawing of this jawbone,
which is deposited in the library. Another interesting character
lives here, but forgotten, neglected, and in great poverty&mdash;I
mean Colonel Vigo, who rendered important services
to the Americans at the capture of Vincennes. They, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>deed,
gave him the rank of colonel, but suffer him to starve.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>In our excursions in the vicinity of this place we found
many interesting plants. Mr. Bodmer took a view of Vincennes
from the top of Warrior's Hill; while Mr. Lesueur
visited the Indian barrows, of which there are several in
the plain, and which the French settlers call <i>mamelon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
One of these hills was examined on a former occasion, and
an excavation made through a wolf's den on one side of it,
but nothing was taken from it but white clay; without
doubt the examination must have been superficial.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June we parted from our friend, Mr. Lesueur,
and left Vincennes by the stage. We first passed
through a tract of alternate meadows and thickets, and then,
for a couple of miles, through the unbroken forests which
characterize Indiana. After proceeding thirteen miles we
came to a solitary post-house in the wood, where breakfast
was ready, and of which we partook while they were changing
horses. We then crossed in a ferry, an arm of White
River, which runs between picturesque wooded banks. The
roads were bad; decayed trunks of trees were constantly in
the way; the ground broken and uneven; and our stage,
drawn by four very spirited horses, sustained many a violent
jolt. We came to Washington and Mount Pleasant,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
where the farmers were cultivating their fields, in which
isolated trees were frequently seen, but which afforded no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>shade from the sultry sun, for they were all destroyed by
the fire. They are cut down, from time to time, when the
people are in want of timber; and, as a sign that they are
to be felled in the next winter, a circular ring is hewn into
the bark. It is said to be very difficult to cultivate the
land in Indiana, on account of the extremely vigorous vegetation.
Except in the vicinity of the Wabash and the White
River, it is, however, not so fertile as in Illinois, where, in
the environs of Springfield, for instance, it is scarcely necessary
to do more than hoe the ground, in order to obtain
the finest crops. An acre of land there yields from sixty
to eighty bushels of maize, and fifty bushels of wheat.
The effects of the frost were everywhere visible on the
trees: it had caused much damage, and killed all the fruit
for this year. The fruits of the field were about as forward
as they would be on the Rhine at this season. In
the plantations there were great numbers of oxen, horses,
sheep, and swine, the former of which were particularly
large and handsome. At Mount Pleasant we {482} found
in the inn a good many books lying about; among them
were some geographical works. From this place we descended
an eminence to the bank of the second arm of
the White River, which flows through fine forests. The
water was transparent, and the banks steep. Being set
over with a ferry, we came to a tall, gloomy forest, consisting
almost wholly of large beech trees, which afforded
a most refreshing shade. The forest continued without
intermission, but the beeches were soon succeeded by other
species of trees indigenous to this country. We passed the
most elevated part of the road through the picturesque forest
scenes, where the lofty crowns of the trees shut out the
sky from our view. They were the most splendid forests
I had yet seen in North America. In the evening we stopped,
twenty-three miles from Mount Pleasant, at a capital inn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
called Horsit, surrounded with farm buildings in good condition.
We were quite astonished at meeting, in this lone,
wild, sequestered spot, with such a respectable house and
table; everything was particularly neat and comfortable.
Early on the morning of the 14th we set out again. About
six miles further on, is the little town of Paoli, in a calcareous
spot, where pieces of limestone everywhere stand out. We
then proceeded by the side of Litcreek, some miles from
whence the stage stopped, and the passengers breakfasted
at the house of Chambers, a Quaker.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> We were told that
this part of the country is very salubrious, and the air extremely
pure, but it takes strangers some time to get
accustomed to the water, which is impregnated with lime.
We saw numbers of horses in the forest, but the breed is
not so good in Indiana as in other states. At Greenville,
a small village, was a large concourse of the neighbouring
farmers, whose horses and vehicles were tied to the fences.
They had come to take part in the election of some magistrate.
The heat was excessive, and the dust very troublesome.
Several parties of farmers were in the public-houses,
where a rude, noisy crowd were drinking whisky and playing
at various games. We soon reached the summit of the
calcareous chain of hills, which we had ascended gradually
and imperceptibly, and approached the southern declivity,
where an extensive and magnificent prospect opened before
us. The wide valley, or, rather, the vast plain of the Ohio,
suddenly unfolds itself to the eye of the astonished traveller.
As far as the eye can reach, a dense, uninterrupted forest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>covers the country, and the beauteous river, like a streak
of silver, meanders through the landscape. In the distance
lie the red masses of the houses of the towns of Louisville
and New Albany, which extend on both sides of the Ohio.
We soon passed the slope of the chain, and drove rapidly
through a highly cultivated country to New Albany, on the
banks of the river.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>I did not stop at New Albany, where there had lately
been several cases of cholera, but proceeded to Louisville,
where we soon arrived, and embarked the same evening,
on board the Paul Jones steamer. In this town, too, there
had been some cases of cholera, but the people did not
seem to be afraid of that disorder. After proceeding about
thirty miles up the Ohio, some accident happened to our
engine, and we were obliged to lay-to. On the following
day, the 15th, the {483} forests of the Ohio appeared in the
luxuriant verdure of the varied foliage of their lofty trees,
among which the colossal planes were especially conspicuous.
Near Kentucky River our engine again broke; it was, however,
repaired, during the night, at Vevay.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>On the 16th we reached Rising Sun, saw Petersburg and
Aurora, where the United States mail steam-boat, the Franklin,
passed rapidly by us, then came to Lawrenceburg, and
arrived about noon at Cincinnati.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Cincinnati is a considerable town, and carries on an extensive
trade, and is frequented by numerous steam-boats,
of which a considerable number were now lying on the
banks of the Ohio. Many travellers have already described
everything worthy of notice in this town, and I will, therefore,
only mention some establishments connected with
natural history, which we were now able to visit at our leisure,
as we were no longer apprehensive of the cholera. The
Western Museum, belonging to Mr. Dorfeuille, which Mrs.
Trollope has described, is the only one worthy of notice.
I observed several interesting articles, though all American
establishments of this kind are calculated, not for the advantage
of science, but for pecuniary gain. This museum
is lighted up every evening at eight o'clock, and an indifferent
concert is performed, chiefly by Germans. In one of the
rooms was a small fountain, round which the visitors sat
upon benches, gazing at it with astonishment. The owner
has a taste for the sciences, and would pay greater attention
to them, if he met with more encouragement to do so; but
his museum did not attract many visitors till he introduced,
in the upper rooms, an absurd representation of hell.
Grottoes, in which a number of frightful skeletons are
moving about, and among whom the devil acts a principal
part; these, and other hideous scenes, attract the
vulgar multitude, and bring considerable profit. Mr.
Dorfeuille has, however, several interesting specimens,
such as petrifactions, fossil impressions, Indian antiquities,
Mexican curiosities, and some fragments of parchment with
hieroglyphics painted on them; the best of which, however,
was at this time in the hands of Mr. Bullock, an Englishman,
who resides some miles from hence, and which I therefore
did not see.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>On examining the booksellers' shops, I found only some
elegantly bound works on the <i>belles lettres</i>, a few on the
statistics of different countries, but none relating to natural
history, nor any portraits or history of the too much
neglected Indian nations. I there formed several valuable
acquaintances, among others, Dr. Daniel Drake, who is
well known as an author, and whose work, "The Picture
of Cincinnati," and other essays, prove that he has not
neglected the study of nature.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> I met with many old acquaintances,
among others, Mr. Richard Owen, of New
Harmony;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and in all my excursions saw great numbers of
Germans, of whom it is estimated that 10,000 reside here.
German is everywhere spoken. German peasants arrived
continually, and traversed the streets, but most of them
are of the lowest and most uneducated class, and are not
calculated to give the Americans a favourable impression
of our nation.</p>

<p>Instead of going immediately into the country, and hiring
themselves to the farmers, in order to learn the nature of
the agriculture {484} of this country, they loiter about the
town, where they fall into the hands of abandoned countrymen
of their own, squander the little property they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>brought with them, and are then despised by the inhabitants.
At present, however, there are many respectable
and intelligent Germans here, who have already contributed
to give the Americans a more favourable opinion of our
people. Some of these estimable men have conceived the
laudable plan of establishing a society for the protection
and settlement of their countrymen, which will certainly
prove highly useful.</p>

<p>On the 19th of June I left this town on board the United
States mail-boat, Guyandotte, and proceeded up the Ohio.
The Lady Scott steamer set out at the same time with us,
but our steamer soon left her far behind. As slavery is
abolished in the state of Ohio, the crew of our vessel were
nearly all white men. There are three such mail-boats,
which have to forward the despatches of the government,
but they perform this office only occasionally, because they
receive only five dollars each time. The most rapid vessels
are chosen for this service; they have the words, "United
States Mail," painted on their paddle-box.</p>

<p>About noon, on the 20th of June, we lay-to at Portsmouth,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
above the mouth of the Sciotto River, and I landed
at this place, intending to proceed on the Ohio Canal.</p>

is noted in our volume xix, p. 189, note 34 (Gregg). As it was situated three miles
from the river, both Wayne City and Blue Mills contended for the business of the
landing place. Portage l'Independence was at the former, or even higher up the

<p>
The person whom Maximilian met was Milton G. Sublette (for whom see
Wyeth's <i>Oregon</i>, in our volume xxi, p. 67, note 44). He went out with the Wyeth
expedition in the spring of 1834, but because of illness turned back (May 8) near
the Kansas River, and had just arrived at Independence Portage when the prince's
vessel came down the Missouri. William L. Sublette, the chief partner of Sublette
and Campbell, had led out a party to the mountains which passed Wyeth's about
May 12. See Townsend's <i>Narrative</i>, in our volume xxi, p. 151; and "Correspondence

<p><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> The knowledge of naturalists respecting reptiles or amphibia has been increased
in a surprising manner of late years. The work now publishing by Messrs.
Dum&eacute;ril and Bibron, promises to be the most complete on the subject. A vast
number of species has been found, some of which are hardly capable of being
sufficiently defined: thus, the authors of the above-mentioned excellent work seemed
to have proceeded, in some cases, rather hastily. I will mention only one or two
instances: vol. v., p. 88, I find in the synopsis, "<i>Tupinambis monitor</i>, Maxim.,
Prince of Wied;" whereas I never thought of calling the lizard in question <i>Tupinambis</i>.
Vol. iii., p. 80, <i>Alligator sclerops</i>, and page 86 the same, where I am quoted
in reference to two species of crocodile, though it is very certain that I could not
observe in Brazil more than one species. In these two descriptions there is much
confusion; and in this respect we must also not follow Spix, who considered the
varieties of age as distinct species. I could quote many other instances, if this
were a proper place for such discussion.
</p>
<p>
In the work of Messrs. Dum&eacute;ril and Bibron there are likewise many mistakes
with respect to the Brazilian reptiles described by me; and it seems that the authors,
like many other French naturalists, quote my descriptions of those animals without
having read or even seen them, otherwise they would certainly have preferred my
statement of the colour of the animals from the life, to a description of the faded
specimens preserved in spirits, which are met with in the museums; or to the equally
incorrect statements of Dr. Spix, who, it is well known, forgot to note the colour
of the animals when alive, and whose representations of them are likewise from
specimens preserved in spirits.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span></p></div>

Scotland, in 1810. He was educated chiefly in Switzerland, and came to New
Harmony (1828) fresh from his literary studies. His tastes inclining to scientific
pursuits, he was associated with his brother, David Dale, in several geological
surveys, among them an exploration (1849) of Lake Superior. He engaged in the
Mexican War with the rank of captain, and in the War of Secession held an Indiana
colonelcy. Upon the death of his brother (1860), Richard Owen was appointed
Indiana state geologist, and for fifteen years thereafter held the chair of natural
science in the state university, publishing a <i>Key to the Geology of the Globe</i>. Upon
retirement from professional duties, Owen returned to New Harmony, where he
occupied the Rapp mansion until his death in 1890.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>Portsmouth is rather an inconsiderable town, with low
houses, and broad, unpaved streets, built in the angle of
the confluence of the Sciotto with the Ohio. Here begins
the Ohio Canal, which connects that river with Lake Erie.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
This fine canal is navigated by numerous boats, which are
built in the same style as the keel-boats of the Missouri, but
have many convenient small chambers; they are from seventy-seven
to eighty feet in length, fourteen in breadth, and are
drawn by two horses, on which the driver is seated. These
Ohio Canal boats are not so well arranged and fitted up as
those on the Erie Canal, where they have distinct boats for
passengers and goods, which is not here the case. They
are also slower, because fewer horses are employed. In
the middle of the boat is the long space for the goods; in
front two small cabins; and at the back is the saloon or
dining room. At the sides of the cabins are cushioned seats,
on which, as well as on the floor, the beds are arranged for
the night. In the other cabins are berths for the ladies.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day on which we arrived we
went on board a canal boat, where I met with an agreeable,
well-informed, travelling companion in Dr. Pitcher, an attentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
observer of nature, and military physician of Fort
Gibson, on the River Orkansa, who was accompanied by
his family.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> We set out at six o'clock in the afternoon, with
very fine weather. The banks of the canal were covered
with wood, especially sugar maples. Before night we came
to some {486} sluices, and a mill with seventy saws for
cutting freestone, which is found in the neighbourhood, into
blocks for building, tombstones, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the 21st we passed through very fine forests of sugar
maples and beeches, where numerous baltimores were flying
about. The country is very fertile; it was formerly clothed
with wood; and the detached block-houses of the settlers
are constantly met with. On many spots of the surrounding
hills the may-apple (<i>Podophyllum</i>) grew in abundance;
others were covered with an undergrowth of the papaw tree:
the kingfisher was frequently seen on the banks of the canal.
Near three combined sluices is a feeder, which connects
the canal with the Sciotto. There is a weir in the river, in the
deep waters of which it is said there are a very great number
of soft-shell tortoises. About a league and a half from Chillicothe,
after passing Indian Creek, the canal is carried over
a stream called Paint Creek. This aqueduct is broad, has
three arches, and two stone pillars, over which the water of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the canal flows; and on each side of the aqueduct is a floored
way, with a railing for the horses and foot passengers. Towards
evening we arrived at Chillicothe, a small town, with
2000 or 3000 inhabitants, in the wild and fertile valley,
which is evidently in a state of rapid improvement.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> There
are about 150 Germans here, who are in general well spoken
of. The breeding of cattle is the chief occupation of the
inhabitants of this part of the country, and they export oxen
and swine. They have, however, begun likewise to follow
agriculture, and now export a small quantity of wheat.</p>

<p>When the first planters settled here, they found two Indian
tribes&mdash;the Shawnees of the Americans, or Chavenons
of the French, and the Wyandots, who had been driven
hither from the north.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> On the spot where the town now
stands were formerly several conical Indian barrows, in
one of which were found some bones, potsherds, and beads,
which were made of hard wood. Another barrow was composed,
at the upper part, of stones; it contained bones, and
two copper bracelets, which appeared to be beaten or hammered,
not cast. A third barrow, overgrown with trees,
which still exists, and is situated on a rather lofty wooded
eminence, had at the summit a mixture of sand and stones,
and then clay, under which were ashes mixed with bones,
which crumbled away when exposed to the air.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>An extremely violent thunder-storm, with torrents of rain,
surprised us when we were leaving Chillicothe, at nine o'clock
in the evening, where an obliging German, of the name of
Bauman, had given us hospitable entertainment. We proceeded
during the night, and early in the morning of the 22nd
passed several sluices, and then traversed a low, wooded
country on the Sciotto, which is here full of small verdant
islands, covered with trees. Fine lofty forest trees adorned
the country; the elder bushes were in blossom; and the
red-headed woodpecker and the kingfisher everywhere displayed
their beautiful plumage. We now came to the considerable
town of Circleville, which has many brick buildings,
and must have increased greatly since {487} it was
visited by Duke Bernhard of Saxe Weimar.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The duke
gives a detailed description of the remarkable ancient walls,
in the interior of which this place was built; but they have been
greatly demolished since that time. The court-house stands
in the centre of the Indian circle wall, and the greater part
of the town still lies within it. This wall enclosed a space
of seventeen acres and three quarters, but the greater part
of it has now disappeared. Withoutside the western extremity
lies a hill, from whose summit an admirable view
of the town, &amp;c., is obtained. Here, too, we see another
deplorable instance of the love of destruction which animates
the Americans; for, instead of preserving these inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>esting
ancient remains with the greatest care, they have
erected buildings exactly on the site of the levelled walls,
respecting the former state and opening of which nothing
now remains, except some scanty, superficial accounts given
by Attwater and other American writers.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>After we left Circleville we saw, on the canal, a great
number of shells (<i>Unio</i>), of a greenish colour, with darker
stripes, which are very frequent here; most of them were
floating without the animal, which was, however, found dead
in some of them. The canal traverses a country agreeably
diversified with wood and meadows, which was formerly
covered with uninterrupted primeval forests. We saw, likewise,
some low, marshy land, overgrown with rushes and
reeds, upon which the beautiful oriole (<i>Psaroc phoeniceus</i>),
with its splendid plumage, was sitting. This fine bird lives
chiefly in the marshes and by the water-side, where it builds
its nest. Sandpipers, and other birds of that kind, animated
the low meadows; and among the bushes I saw the rice-bird.</p>

<p>After traversing a wooded country, with remarkably fine
sugar maples and walnut trees, we came to Walnut Creek,
which flows through a shady forest. Near the little town,
Lockbourn, which was founded only three years ago, there
are eight sluices close together, where the Columbia feeder
issues from the canal, which rises at this place about 100<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
feet, and then runs along the eminence.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The forest is
not so lofty on the summit, and the tops of many of the
trees are withered. Thus we traversed by water the fine
forest of the state of Ohio, and, as it was Sunday, saw the
inhabitants in their best dresses. It was a most agreeable
journey, during which we sat quite at our ease on the deck.
We had left the Sciotto at Lockbourn, passed Waterloo,
Winchester, Havensport, New Baltimore, and Millersport,
and on the morning of the 23rd reached the highest point
over which the canal has to pass.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> This point is called
Licking Summit, because it is in Licking township, in the
county of Muskingum, which contains the towns of Irville
and Nashport. From Portsmouth to the highest point of
the canal there are fifty-one sluices.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> At sunrise we reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Hebron, a town commenced in November, 1825, in Union
township, on the great national road from Zanesville to
Columbus, which commences at Hagerstown, comes from
Cumberland, on the Potomac, and passes through the states
of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Many workmen were employed
upon the road, and a quantity of stones was brought,
on the canal, in large square flat boats. About nine o'clock
we passed the first three sluices downwards, {488} for the
canal gradually descends from Licking Summit to Lake
Erie. We came to Licking River, and soon after to the
little town of Newark, through which the canal passes. In
the year 1830 Newark had 1000 inhabitants, but has now
considerably increased. This town has broad streets, a
large market-place, and several new churches.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> All the
plantations and fields in this part of the country have fences,
on which the red-headed woodpecker is frequently seen.
Seven miles from Newark the canal joins Licking River, a
very pretty little stream, which flows through a picturesque
rocky valley, overgrown with pines and other trees. The
rocks, which appear to consist of grauwacke, have a singular
stratification, with caverns in which the cattle seek the protection
of the shade from the sultry sun. The passage of about
a mile or a mile and a half through this beautiful wooded
chain of hills is very romantic. It is succeeded by open
spots with plantations, where the canal leaves the Licking,
which it soon afterwards approaches more closely. In the
hollow between the two waters many lofty trees were growing,
especially planes and poplars, partly entwined with lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>climbers. It is sixteen miles from Newark to Nashport, a
small place, where some Indian barrows still exist. The
bank of the canal is covered with verbascum in flower,
which was introduced from Europe. Ironstone and coal
are found in the vicinity. On the banks there is always
some wood, but not so tall or luxuriant as on and near the
Ohio. Sometimes we came to picturesque spots, then to
sluices, and to a great many bridges, under which the boats
have to pass: sometimes the canal runs in a straight line
through beech forests. About twenty-three miles from Newark
it is carried, at a considerable height, over the Tomaha
Creek. We then came to the village of Frazeysburg, a
place with detached wooden houses, where many witch-hazel
bushes grow on the side of the canal, the branches of which
were formerly used for divination, like those of the hazel
bush in Europe; for this superstition was brought by the
emigrants across the Atlantic Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>During the night we passed the little villages of Webbsport
and Roscoe, and at daybreak came to Evansburg, and
then to New-comers Town, a village which has now only
seven or eight houses.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The country round is pleasant
and diversified. In the canal a yellow-striped snake swam
rapidly past us. We had seen the black snake and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>water snake the day previous. Near the village of Port
Washington, the valley was broad and wooded;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> having
passed which, we came to Gnadenh&uuml;tten, a village consisting
of about seven houses, originally founded by the Moravians,
who have, however, abandoned it. The present inhabitants
are chiefly of German origin; they speak German,
and among them were some newly arrived German settlers.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
In this country, near Trenton and Newcastle, are considerable
coal mines.</p>

<p>At Lockport, a small village in Tuscarora county, there
are beautiful prospects from the river; the banks are clothed
with forests, the stagnant branches are covered with nymph&aelig;a,
and other water plants, and immense plains stand in the
valleys. At Dover, a neat little town, in an agreeable situation,
the canal comes very near the river; over this is a
large covered bridge, in the {489} erection, much timber
has been needlessly expended.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Not far from Dover is
Zoar, a pretty settlement of W&uuml;rtemberg Separatists, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>which we arrived in the cool of the evening. A man named
B&auml;umler, who is advanced in years, but said to possess considerable
talents, is the chief of this colony; it is in Tuscarora
County, on the east bank of the river of the same name.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
In the year 1833, this colony had sixty very neat buildings,
all roofed with new red tiles, which are not common in
America, and which looked remarkably well in the green
valley. At a distance we observed considerable buildings,
and the inn in the form of a church. The Ohio Gazetteer
says, that the settlement was originally founded on a piece
of land of 4,000 acres, which the company purchased in 1810,
and the greater part of which is now well cultivated.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The
Separatists possess, besides, 1500 or 2000 acres of land in
the vicinity, as well as some vineyards, which are said to produce
very good wine. The situation of Zoar, at the bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>of the broad level valley, with luxuriant fields and lofty
trees, at a short distance from the river, is extremely pleasant.
The inhabitants are said to be very industrious, and to have
several manufactories, and I regret that I was unable to
make myself better acquainted with this interesting place.
A long wooden bridge is thrown across the canal and the
river: close by is an inn, built by the inhabitants, and called
the Zoar Canal Hotel. Just as I was at the spot, the shepherd
drove a numerous flock of sheep over the bridge, and
answered my questions in genuine Swabian German. His
entire dress and equipments were quite in the German fashion:
a shepherd's crook, a broad leather bandolier, ornamented
with brass figures, a flat broad-brimmed hat, and
a large grey coat; a costume very uncommon in America.
His dogs, too, were exceedingly careful in keeping the flock
together. During the night we passed the villages of Bolivar
and Bethlehem, and at daybreak, on the 25th of June, were
at Massillon, a picturesque spot, in Stark County, which
was founded in 1826, and has now 100 houses and 500 inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>At eight o'clock we reached Fulton, a village with some
neat houses in Stark County. This whole country was manifestly
once covered with a primeval forest. The cat-bird was
common on the banks; we observed turtles, bull-frogs, and
tree-frogs, and often saw snakes swimming rapidly across
the canal. There were most charming wood scenes on
the Tuscarora, where a dwarf-rose grew in abundance, and
had a most pleasing appearance with its large flowers. About
noon we reached the town of New Portage, where the traders
used formerly to convey the goods which were intended for
the trade with the Indians, from one river to the other.
Soon afterwards we came to a marshy place, with a forest
of larches, which shed their leaves in the winter time: it
grows round a small lake, through which the canal passes.
A bridge is built over the whole length of the lake, for the
horses which tow the canal boats. A little further on, where
the canal expands into a kind of small lake, is Akron, a
considerable town in a remarkable situation.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>founded in 1825 in Portage County, and has already an extensive
trade, many neat wooden houses, stores, manufactories,
an iron foundry, and an establishment where, {490}
by means of a wheel, bedsteads and other articles of furniture
are turned. At Akron the valley begins to decline
rapidly: the canal passes through the middle of the town,
and, in order to bring the boats down from a considerable,
steep, rocky eminence, ten or twelve sluices are erected one
above the other. The vicinity is one of the most curious
spots on the course of the canal, with scattered buildings,
a busy population, much water, and fine forests. On reaching
the foot of the eminence, you glide along the beautiful
dark brown mirror of the canal, through luxuriant verdure,
where wood and meadows alternate, and the tall tulip, walnut,
and sassafras trees reflect their graceful forms in the
unruffled surface of the water. The sluices, of which we
counted twenty-one in a space of two miles and a half, were
at greater intervals from each other as we approached the
River Cayahoga, which the canal follows to Lake Erie.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The next morning we were still five miles from Lake
Erie, a distance which we accomplished at about ten o'clock,
when we reached the little town of Cleveland. The sea-like
expanse of the large Lake Erie was very striking when emerging
from the wooded valleys, and the sight of it reminded
me of my approaching voyage to my native country. The
dark blue lake stretches to the far horizon, like the ocean;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the eye is attracted by the white sails and the smoke of
the steam-boats; while the finest weather and the purest
atmosphere favoured the illusion.</p>

<p>Cleveland is a large, rapidly improving town, with several
thousand inhabitants, full of life, trade, and business.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
It is situated in Cayahoga or Cuyahoga County, and is built
partly on a high ridge, partly on the river below. The outskirts
are scattered, but the principal streets are regular.
It contains many large buildings, several churches, a school
or academy, a prison, good inns, and numerous shops and
stores; the trade is very considerable in consequence of the
junction of the great lakes with the Ohio and the Mississippi.
Numbers of canal boats are assembled here, and also the
two-masted schooners which navigate the lake. Several
large, commodious steamers, generally full of passengers,
come and depart daily. The Cayahoga flows through the
lower part of the town; both sides of the mouth of the river
are lined with wood; and on the right bank there is a long
mole, with a lighthouse at the extremity. A second lighthouse
is built a little to the right, upon an eminence; and
in the far distance, on the right hand, the coast is lost in
the misty horizon, and, on the left, disappears amid thick
forests.</p>

<p>We met with many Germans at Cleveland, especially
newly-arrived emigrants, and also an obliging young fellow-countryman,
whom I had seen at Pittsburg, and who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
obtained a good situation in a mercantile house in this place.
Several steam-boats arrived and departed, bound to Detroit,
and, at length, the Oliver Newbery came in, on its
way to Buffalo. I immediately availed myself of the opportunity
to visit that town, and set out from Cleveland at
noon. On leaving the mouth of the Cayahoga there is an
uninterrupted view of the vast expanse of Lake Erie, the
splendid bluish-green waters of which, like those of all the
great Canadian lakes, are exactly of the same colour as
those of Switzerland. The dark brown waters of the Cayahoga
are strongly contrasted {491} to a considerable distance
with those of the lake.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> We steered along the south bank,
where we had a fine prospect of Cleveland, and we were
favoured by the most charming weather, which showed the
lake to great advantage: in a storm the waves often run
very high, and prove dangerous to navigation. The southern
or American shore is not much elevated; the northern
forms the boundary of Canada, the English possessions
in North America. The south coast has no lofty eminences,
and is entirely covered with forests. The steamer touched
at Fairport, Ashtabula, and Salem, where great numbers
of bats were hovering over the entrance into the port. After
leaving Salem our engine got into disorder; and on the following
morning, the 27th, we reached Dunkirk, a small
place, built in the Dutch fashion, of which there is no mention
in the Ohio Gazetteer of 1833.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> A lighthouse stands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>on a neighbouring point of land. At eleven o'clock we came
in sight of Buffalo, lying at the end of the lake, where we
saw a race between two large steam-boats. As we approached
the town, where we landed at twelve o'clock, a great number
of steamers presented a very animated scene. Buffalo
has been rapidly improving of late, and in a few years will
be a considerable and important place. It has at present
about 1000 houses, and 12,000 inhabitants, and promises
to become one of the chief commercial ports of the country.
The Erie Canal, which connects the great lakes with the
eastern seaports of the Union, commences here. In the
summer months, the neighbouring Falls of Niagara attract
a great number of strangers, all of whom visit Buffalo. The
streets of this town are, for the most part, regular and broad,
crossing each other at right angles, and contain many handsome
brick buildings, large inns, nine or ten churches and
chapels, and good shops and magazines of every kind. In
the lower part of the town, the water of the lake and the
canal has been conducted into the streets, forming small
harbours, where numbers of ships lie in perfect security.
The town extends along the slope, and on the ridge of a
gentle eminence; and from one of the highest points there
is a striking prospect of the bright mirror of Lake Erie,
which vanishes in the misty distance, and on the land side,
of the Niagara River, and its opposite or Canadian bank.
Buffalo was burnt by the English in 1814; it is said that
only one house was left standing. The town was not immediately
rebuilt, and it is only since the construction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>fine Erie Canal that it has risen so rapidly. When we consider
the shortness of the time, the sudden improvement
of the town, which is now of so much importance, really
seems incredible; and perhaps there is no other country in
the world where such a sudden rise would be possible.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
They are now laying down iron railroads, one of which is
to lead to Niagara. There are at present above thirty steam-boats
for the communication between Buffalo, Cleveland,
Detroit, and Niagara, and the number increases every year.
The object, however, which most attracted me was the village
of the Seneca Indians, in the vicinity of Buffalo. They
possess a piece of land, which begins a mile and a half southeast
of the town. Here they live in small, neat, wooden
houses, which are surrounded by their fields {492} and plantations,
in a wooded country, and the pretty little church is
in the centre of this Indian colony. The Indians who are
settled here are employed in agriculture, the breeding of cattle
and horses; and, like other country people, they go to
the town with their wagons. Their dress is nearly the same
as that of the Whites. Both the men and women frequently
wear round felt hats: the men have, in general, a red girdle
under their large blue upper coat, and the women wrap
themselves in blankets. I found the physiognomy of most
of these people quite genuine and characteristically Indian,
as well as the brown colour, and their smooth, coal-black
hair; some of them do not much differ in this respect
from the Missouri tribes. A good many of them speak English,
but some are quite ignorant of it; and, in their communications
with each other, all use the old Indian dialect.
It is said that there were at first 900 Indians settled here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>mostly Senecas, mixed with a few Onondagos and Cayugas;
but their numbers have decreased. All these tribes spoke
the same language. They received from the government
49,000 acres of very fine fertile land. They have a clergyman
and a school. The inn is kept by a half-breed Indian,
who, however, did not appear to value himself on his Indian
descent, but rather desired to be considered a white man.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The Senecas are one of the six nations who, in former
times, were the enemies of the French in Canada, and,
with the exception of the Oneidas, assisted the English, in
the war of 1775, against the Americans. The works of
Charlevoix, Lahontan, and Colden, give information respecting
the history of these once powerful, warlike people,
who dwelt on the borders of the great lakes. The six allied
nations were the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagos, Tuscaroras,
Oneidas, and Mohawks; the latter came from the
south, and were admitted at a later period into the union
of the five tribes.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>We visited some of these families, who showed us their
bibles and prayer books in the Indian language; we bought
specimens of their work, adorned with porcupine and other
dyed quills, and likewise bows and arrows, which they still
esteem. Deeply regretting the destruction of the remarkable
aboriginal inhabitants of the east of North America,
I returned in the evening to Buffalo, where our baggage
and the live animals were embarked under the superintendence
of Dreidoppel, on board an Erie Canal boat, for
Albany, a distance of 363 miles. I myself took a place in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>the stage for Niagara, and we left Buffalo on the 28th of
June. The road lies along the Erie Canal, which is here
parallel with the River Niagara, passes through the village
of Blackrock, and, near the hamlet of Tonawanta, crosses
the creek of that name, which falls, at no great distance,
into the river.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>The River Niagara issues from the east end of Lake
Erie, forming the channel which connects it with Lake Ontario,
the level of which is lower. The length of the
course of the Niagara, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario,
is 36&frac12; miles, and its fall in this distance amounts
to 322 feet. It is the frontier between Canada and the
United States, and forms, between the two great lakes, the
celebrated waterfall. Its surface is adorned with several
islands, the largest of which, called {493} Grand Island,
was sold in 1815, by the Seneca Indians, to the state of
New York, for 1000 dollars, and an annuity of 500 dollars.
This island is said to be twelve miles long, and from
two to seven broad: it is in the vicinity of Lake Erie, and
the river is afterwards pretty free from islands till you come
near the falls, where there are several small ones. The
water of the Niagara has the splendid green colour of the
Swiss lakes, and is nearly twice as broad as the Rhine; on
the opposite bank is the village of Chippeway, where, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the 5th of July, 1814, there was an action, in which the
English were defeated.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>There is a considerable population along the road from
Tonawanta to the falls of Niagara, which are twenty-two
miles from Buffalo. Towards noon we came to the village
of Niagara, which we entered at the side furthest from
the river, and put up at a very good inn. It is a small
village close to the falls, forming two irregular unpaved
streets, but containing some good houses.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The banks
present a very picturesque diversity, with pines and other
trees, bearing a general resemblance to the scenery of
Switzerland. Opposite to our inn was the house of a
man named Hooker, who acts as guide to travellers visiting
the falls, and has a small collection of natural curiosities,
and specimens of Indian manufacture.</p>

<p>The grand, sublime scene, which we now visited, has
been described by a vast number of travellers&mdash;Larochefaucault-Liancourt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Weld, Volney,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and many others since
their time;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> so that all accounts must be in some measure
mere repetitions; but, as the diversity of such descriptions
can but tend to give a more correct view of the subject, a
few remarks may not be considered irrelevant here.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the village of Niagara, the river,
which, according to Volney, is 1200 feet in breadth, begins
to flow in an uneven rocky bed, with a rapid descent, and
its whole surface is, in many places, in violent commotion,
covered with white foam, and, as it were, boiling, in consequence
of its breaking in high waves against the masses
of rock. Portions of these rocks, the larger of which deserve
the name of islands, are covered with pines, some
green, others in a decayed state: of these rocky islets there
are fifteen above the falls. The pines being frequently
broken and snapped, and here and there piled up in the
water, greatly contribute to heighten the effect of the savage
grandeur and sublimity of the scene. The roaring of
the cataract is heard at a considerable distance,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>lofty columns of mist and vapour ascend into the air. The
stranger is conducted from the village to the above-mentioned
rapid, and then proceeds, by a long, strongly-built
wooden bridge over the end of the rapid, to Bath Island,
where there are warm and cold baths (<i>a</i>, in the subjoined
woodcut).<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> A considerable paper-mill has {494} been
erected here, and a toll for passing the bridge is paid, once
for all, for the whole time you may remain here. The
toll-keeper sells refreshments and various curiosities of the
country, minerals, Indian rarities, and the like.</p>

<p>A second bridge leads from Bath Island to Goat Island,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
which is about seventy acres in extent, entirely covered
with a beautiful forest of sugar maples, beeches, hornbeams,
elms, birches, &amp;c., beneath which the asarabaca,
may-apple, and various other plants, are growing; none of
them were, however, in flower. The shores of this island
are shaded by old pines and very large white cedars, such
as we should in vain look for in Europe, and many fine
shrubs grow on the banks. There were formerly a great
number of Virginian deer in this beautiful forest, but they
grew so familiar, and became so troublesome by running
after strangers, that they were removed. The blueheaded
jay and the Hudson's Bay squirrel are numerous. From
the bridge which leads to Goat Island there is a convenient
path, on the right hand, which goes along the shore
through the wood; and, after proceeding a short distance,
the stranger suddenly finds himself on the rather steep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>declivity, immediately above the fall of the right or southern
arm of the river, which is called the American branch.
The sight is striking, and much grander than all the descriptions
I had read of it led me to conceive. The broad
expanse of bright green water falls perpendicularly 144 to
150 feet into the abyss below, which is entirely concealed
by the vapour, the whole torrent of falling water being
completely dissolved into foam and mist in the midway
of its descent. Below the fall, and before its surface is
quite calm, it recovers its green colour, which is, of course,
totally lost in the rapidity of its descent. To make my
description more clear, I subjoin a little plan of the cataracts
drawn by Mr. George Catlin,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and published in
Featherstonehaugh's "Essay on the Ancient Drainage of
North America, and the Origin of the Cataract of Niagara,"
in the Monthly American Journal of Geology, Vol. I., July,
1831.</p>

<p>The southern or American part of the fall, <i>c</i>, is divided
above by a narrow rocky island, <i>f</i>, to which a bridge
has been thrown. This rocky island is closely overgrown
with white cedar {495} (<i>Arbor vit&aelig;</i>), the tall, thick, whitish
trunks of which, with their stiff, extended boughs, scarcely
leave space for the shrubs that grow between them, in
which the cedar bird (<i>Bombycilla cedrorum</i>) builds its nest.
The northern chatterer or silk tail, of which the Prince of
Musignano<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> has given a plate in his "Supplement to
Wilson's Ornithology," is likewise found here in small companies
during the winter. After we had admired the lesser,
or American part of the fall, we returned to the top of Goat
Island, again following the path which now runs along the
eastern edge of the island through the dark shade of the
forest, and, having gone between 500 and 600 paces, came
in sight of the second larger fall, which is called the English
or Horse-shoe Fall, <i>b</i>, which is formed by the left, or
the northern arm of the river. This splendid waterfall
occupies the whole breadth of the bed of the river, forming,
towards the Canadian shore, a receding angle, where the
masses of water from both sides of the Horse-shoe meeting
each other, fall, with a thundering noise, in one conjoined
body, 150 feet perpendicular height. The clouds
of vapour that rise from this cataract are far more considerable
than those of the American fall. They cover
and veil the neighbouring rocky, wooded banks, by their
rising columns, in which the sun forms the most beautiful
rainbows. In the angle of the fall, where the waters, pouring
from three several sides, meet with a fearful concussion,
and, dissolving into snow-white spray, are lost to the
eye in vapour, they rage and boil with tremendous fury.
This is the focus from whence rise the clouds of steam
and vapour which involve the circumjacent country to a
great distance in rain and mist, and, according to the direction
of the wind, assume manifold and most fantastic
forms.</p>

<p>In order to approach nearer to the sublime scene, a staircase
has been contrived on the steep bank at the place
where we now stood, and where a small house, with seats,
<i>m</i>, has been built; and below, at <i>h</i>, a wooden tower is
erected, with a winding stair, from the upper gallery of
which, as well as from windows made here and there at
the sides, there is a view of the wondrous scene, gradually
changing as you ascend. Here we were struck mute at
the overwhelming sight of this abyss of waters.</p>

<p>Beautiful plants grow among the boulders, the rocks on
the banks of the river, such as the gueldar rose, the white
cedar, the <i>Rubus odoratus</i>, now flowering in all its loveli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>ness,
the lime, maple, and sumach. By proceeding from
the waterfall, below the bank of Goat Island, along the
river, and round the point of the island, we come to the
cauldron of the American fall, and can almost go under
the precipitous mass of waters, at the risk of encountering
the penetrating rain and wind. In the same manner one
may likewise get under the Horse-shoe Fall, and both are
points of view indescribably interesting. We now ascended
the wooden stair, and came to the small house, from whence,
in the gloomy shade of the forest, we enjoyed a view of
the surpassing scene from above. The walls are here completely
covered with names and initials of visitants from
all quarters of the globe. After resting here, the delighted
spectator is conducted, by another stair, to the river below,
and thence, across a long wooden bridge, to a high stone
tower, built on the {496} rock, in the water. This tower
is erected immediately over the angle of the Horse-shoe
abyss; it is ascended by a stair, and the visitor is suddenly
transported into an entirely new scene of stupendous magnificence.
The eye is lost in the depth of the foaming
whirlpool, the light spray of which envelops the admiring
spectator, whose ear is stunned with the roaring sound of
the cataract. No language can describe the grandeur and
sublime impression of the scene, from which we could with
difficulty tear ourselves. We remained long lost in admiration
while contemplating the unique phenomenon; and,
returning to our inn, made an excursion, some time afterwards,
to the other side of the river. For this purpose we
descended, by a covered wooden staircase, from the village
of Niagara to the south side of the American fall, and
came to the bank of the river below the falls. Though
not more than 300 or 400 paces beneath them, the water
is but very slightly agitated, and we were soon ferried over
to the Canadian bank. Here we had the falls directly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>fore
us, and enjoyed an excellent view of both. From
this spot Mr. Bodmer took his general view of this sublime
scene, which is the best that I have yet met with, and is,
in every respect, perfectly faithful to nature.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> On the
eminence above there is what is here called a confectionary,
in which there are some tolerably good representations
of the falls by Megarey. From this place we went to an
isolated house, in which an Englishman has placed a zoological
cabinet, which contains a fine collection of the birds
of Canada. It occupies two stories of the house, and is
shown for money. There are many interesting specimens,
but I met with only a few that I could purchase. At a
short distance from this house is a small projection from
the high bank, called Table Rock, from which there is an
incomparable view of the Horse-shoe Fall, which has been
described by many persons.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> At a neighbouring dwelling
the curious traveller is provided with a covering of
oiled silk, or oiled cloth, to enable him, without getting
wet, to descend a high flight of steps which leads him under
the rushing mass of waters of the Canadian fall.</p>

<p>The next day being Sunday, I took the opportunity to
go and see divine service performed among the Tuscarora
Indians, who are settled about eight miles from the Falls
of Niagara. The road to it leads towards Lake Ontario,
along the high banks of the beautiful Niagara River, alternating
with woods and fields, where the inhabitants live
dispersed in their wooden houses. The forests consist of
furs, Weymouth pines, oaks, chestnuts (the latter in full
bloom), sassafras, and wild cherry trees, the fruit of which
was not yet ripe. The European fruit trees were loaded
with fruit, and appeared not to have suffered from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>frost, but the Italian poplar does not seem to thrive in this
climate. About three miles from Niagara, the view, looking
back on the falls, was very striking; the clouds of spray
and vapour rose at this time very high, and were most
splendidly illumined by the sun's rays. A mile and a half
further on we looked down into a wild ravine, 150 or 200
feet, overgrown with pines and other trees, under which
the river forms a rapid, covered with white foam. This
rapid is called the Devil's Hole; but the descriptions {497}
given of it are greatly exaggerated, for in Europe, in
Switzerland for instance, there are much grander scenes of
this kind. A small English corps here suffered a defeat
in the American war, being driven by the Americans and
their Indian allies into this ravine.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>When I had passed the wood and came again into the
fields, where the scattered houses of the Indians, built in
the European style, are situated, I saw before me their
small white church, and had a near and charming view of
the wooded rocky shores of the splendid green Ontario.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
The scenery about that lake and the Niagara, and that on
the banks of the Hudson, is, unquestionably, the finest that
I saw in North America. The road leads along the edge
of the valley of the Niagara, and affords a wide view into
the distant plain beyond Lake Ontario. A gloomy forest
extends, without interruption, to the distant horizon, and
in the foreground there is a dark inlet, where the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>the lake is hidden by lofty trees. Volney very accurately
describes this scene as "Une v&ecirc;ritable mer de for&ecirc;ts, parsem&eacute;es
de quelque fermes et villages, et de nappes d'eau
des lacs Iroquois."</p>

<p>I drove up to the church, which was crowded with Indians;
the clergyman was already in the pulpit. As he
did not understand the language of the Tuscaroras, he
preached in English, and the schoolmaster at his side interpreted
all he said.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> When the sermon was ended and
prayers read, during which all the Indians remained sitting,
the interpreter began to sing, and the congregation, in
which there were only three or four Whites, joined in a very
good tone, the men generally singing a second part. The
clergyman, a young man, who had not been long in this
parish, gave me some account of his congregation, which
consisted of about 300 souls. Another portion of the Tuscaroras
is settled, I think, on Grand River.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Very few
understand English&mdash;they are Presbyterians, and live on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>the whole like the Senecas, whom they resemble in external
appearance, and whose language is the same. There
is less originality among them than among the Senecas at
Buffalo. Their features, colour, and hair seem to be more
changed by their intercourse with the Whites; yet I saw,
now and then, a characteristic physiognomy, especially
among the women. They are of middle stature, and their
dress is like that of the Senecas at Buffalo. They were
allied with the English in the American war.</p>

<p>After a stay of several days, the greater part of which
was passed on the banks of the great falls, lost in admiration
of their sublimity, I took the stage to Tonawanta,
intending to return to New York by Lake Erie and the
River Hudson.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

Vermont. He entered the army (1822) as assistant surgeon, becoming surgeon
with rank of major in 1832. In 1836 he resigned from the army, and began practice
in Detroit, where he became a prominent citizen. In 1842 and 1844-47 he
was mayor of the city, held the office of county (1843) and city physician (1848-51),
and served upon the board of health. Dr. Pitcher was interested in education
and was one of the first regents of the University of Michigan (1837-51), giving much
time and thought to the establishment of that institution, especially its medical
school. Upon retiring from the board of regents, he was made professor emeritus
of medicine. Dr. Pitcher's literary interests were considerable; he was librarian
of the first Michigan Historical Society, editor of the <i>Peninsular Journal of Medicine</i>,
and contributor to Schoolcraft's work on Indians, in whose therapeutics he
took much interest. His home in Detroit was the seat of widespread hospitality.

Circleville was so named from an ancient earthwork found upon the site. Near
this place were the chief villages of the Shawnee, also the Pickaway Plains, well

treaty of Camp Charlotte (see <i>Dunmore's War</i>, cited in note 153 above, pp. <a href="#Page_302">302</a>,

population in 1900 was about seven thousand.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

and follows its eastern bank as far as Lockbourne, on the southern boundary of
Franklin County, passing Walnut Creek&mdash;an eastern affluent of the Scioto&mdash;in
Pickaway County. Lockbourne was laid out in 1831, by Colonel Kilbourne, who
compounded its title from the eight canal locks at this site, and the last syllable
of his own name. The spur of the canal which runs hence to Columbus (not
Columbia) is eleven miles in length. The first canal-boat to make the trip from
Chillicothe to Columbus passed over the route in 1831. Its arrival at the state
capital was the occasion of a celebration in honor of the completion of the enterprise.

Columbus was laid out (1812) on the east bank of the Scioto, opposite the older

Delawares, in the middle of the eighteenth century, removed from the Allegheny to
the Tuscarawas Valley, their principal chief, Netawatwes (the Newcomer), built

this atrocity, the village of Gnadenh&uuml;tten was deserted. About 1798 it was restored
by the Moravians, and the following year white settlers began to move in. The

their homes in several parties. One of these, led by George Rapp, founded the
New Harmony and Economy settlement; another, under the leadership of Joseph
M. B&auml;umler, came to Philadelphia in 1817, and by December of that year had
begun a settlement on the Tuscarawas, which they named Zoar. Not until 1819
was the community system established, and then because of the exigencies of the
situation and their position on the frontier, rather than doctrinaire theory. The
numbers of the settlement were largely increased in 1832, when a second band
arrived from W&uuml;rtemberg. The leader of the colony, Joseph B&auml;umler (later spelled
Bimeler), was of obscure peasant origin, but a man of ability and enterprise. Under
his care the community prospered until his death in 1852. Celibacy was at first
imposed as a rule of the community, but later was rescinded. In 1898, by mutual
consent of the members, the community dissolved, the majority still living at the
village of Zoar, which in 1900 possessed but two hundred and ninety inhabitants.

to the Ohio Canal. The town was laid out in 1825 by two proprietors from Canton,
Ohio, who at first christened it Kelleysville, for one of the canal commissioners.
He, however, declined the honor, whereupon the name of the South American
emancipator was chosen. Between the villages of Zoar and Bolivar, Maximilian
passed the site of the former Fort Laurens, erected during the Revolution
(1778) as an outpost for the protection of the Western frontiers. In February and
March, 1779, the garrison, under command of Colonel John Gibson, sustained
a protracted siege by a motley host of Wyandot and Mingo warriors, led by a few
British soldiers. After the raising of the siege, Fort Laurens was found too remote
from the frontier to be provisioned without undue risk; whereupon, in the
autumn of 1779, the post was abandoned.

Post, built (1761) within its precincts the first cabin in the present state of Ohio

of the township, was laid out about 1806 by Jonathan W. Condy, who intended
to found there a religious society of Swedenborgians, upon the model of the
Moravian settlement in Pennsylvania. The plan failed, and the village only revived

New Portage is the southern terminus of the once well-known portage path
from the Cuyahoga to the Tuscarawas, which furnished in early Indian history
the most practicable route from Lake Erie to the Ohio. The road was about eight
miles long, and has recently been retraced; consult A. B. Hulbert, <i>Red-Men's Roads</i>
(Columbus, 1900), p. 33. This path also furnished a boundary between Indian
Territory and that of the United States, as agreed upon by the treaties of Fort
McIntosh (1785), Fort Harmar (1789), and Greenville (1795). The American
town of New Portage was expected to be the future metropolis of the region, but

arrive with more frequency, the village being incorporated in 1814. The era of
prosperity opened in Cleveland with the period of canal transportation. The inauguration
of the Erie Canal (1825) gave impetus to the place, which increased with
rapidity when made the terminus of the Erie and Ohio Canal. Cleveland was

Tonawanda Creek rises in Wyoming County, New York, flows north through
Genesee, and, turning west, forms the boundary between Niagara and Erie counties,
entering Niagara River opposite Grand Island. The name in the Seneca language
means "rapids," or "riffles." The site of the town of Tonawanda was first settled
in 1808; three years later, a block-house was built, in anticipation of an Indian
attack, nevertheless, during the War of 1812-15, the hamlet was burned, and little
was done to rebuild the place until 1823, when, upon prospect of the near approach
of the Erie Canal, the town was platted. The village growth was slow, however, and

Maximilian; the price aggregated about $11,000. In 1819 squatters were driven
off by order of the state, and in 1824 the island was surveyed and opened for
purchase. A contemplated Jewish settlement, to be called Ararat, came to nought.

lands until the period of the American Revolution. When General John Sullivan
raided the Iroquois territory (1779) he was ordered to spare the neutral Tuscarora;
the British sympathizers among them fled to the English Fort Niagara, and after
the war the majority of the tribe settled upon a tract a mile square, given them by
the Seneca, two miles east of the fort. Later the Holland Land Company ceded
to this tribe two square miles of contiguous territory, and still later the Tuscarora
purchased 4,329 acres with the proceeds of a sale of their North Carolina lands.
Here the majority of the tribe lives to this day. In 1813, their houses and
church were burned by a raid of British Indians, whereupon the Tuscarora retreated
to Oneida Castle, to return to their reservation at the close of the war.
From 1838-46 there was agitation about removal, first to Wisconsin, later to Indian
Territory. Of one band who went out (about 1846), a third died in a year,
and many returned to their old homes. The Tuscarora are the most progressive
Indians of the state of New York, having good farms and fine orchards; many
desire to become citizens, and to have their lands allotted in severalty. See

Society, and for some years conducted by the American Board of Foreign Missions;
in 1821 the charge of this mission was transferred to the Presbyterians. At the
time of Maximilian's visit Reverend Joel Wood was the missionary, but he remained
only one year (October, 1833-October, 1834). The few Tuscarora who had followed
Joseph Brant to Canada after the Revolutionary War settled on Grand

<p>Early in the morning of the 1st of July we left the Eagle
Hotel, at Niagara, and travelled twelve miles to Tonawanta,
where we found a packet boat, towed by three
horses, on board which we embarked about noon. The
boats on the Erie Canal are much the same as those on
the Ohio Canal; but here they are fitted up only for passengers,
and take no goods on board, except their baggage;
hence they are more convenient, lighter, and more rapid
than luggage boats. Our boat had fourteen or sixteen
berths, which were very commodiously arranged. The
horses drawing these boats are always on the trot, and
they perform a distance of 104 miles in twenty-four hours.
Twelve hundred such boats navigate this canal, the original
cost of which was 700,000 dollars; whereas that of
the Ohio Canal was only 400,000. This great work was
commenced in 1817, and completed in eight years.</p>

<p>We proceeded first on the Tonawanta River as far as
the village of Pentleton, where we entered the canal. About
five miles from this place it is cut through a stratum of
grauwacke, which rises from four to fifteen feet above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
water; but the depth of the ravine soon increases, and the
bridges are thrown, at a great height, over the canal. At
Lockport, an extensive place, situated on the eminence, the
canal is conducted, by means of five sluices, down a slope
of at least sixty feet.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The prospect from the eminence is
very beautiful. The canal descends between two hills, connected
at a considerable elevation by a bridge, under which
the boats pass. On the following day {499} we came to
Rochester, on the River Genessi, which has a large aqueduct
eighty feet in length. This river is celebrated for its
waterfalls. There are many fine forests, especially of beech;
some, however, consist entirely of oaks. I observed in the
canal many turtles and water-snakes. Near the village of
Perinton is Irondequot or Irondequit Creek, with wooded
banks. The forests here were filled with the finest species
of trees. Beyond Fairport the <i>Arbor vit&aelig;</i> grew vigorously
to the height of thirty and forty feet, as well as larches,
planes, walnuts, oaks, elms, maples, all entwined by wild
vine and ivy.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The peculiar smell of the <i>Arbor vit&aelig;</i> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>powerfully wafted to us by the wind. These forests are
wild and magnificent. Dry trunks of pines lay confusedly
one over another: in the shade cattle were feeding, whose
bells produced an agreeable harmony. We could have
fancied ourselves transported to the forests of the Hartz, if
the country had been mountainous. The wheat was not
yet ripe, nor the potatoes in blossom. The land was still
in part covered with the stumps of the trees that had been
cut down. All the dwellings are of wood, and the fields
are everywhere intersected by wooden fences. The dense
beech forests constantly reminded us of the scenery of
Germany.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we came to the rising town of Clyde,
which lies on Clyde River, and towards evening to the Montezuma
Marshes, which are about three miles in extent.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
They are formed by the overflowing of the lakes of Cayuga
and Seneca,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and the water in them is said to be from four
to eight feet deep. The farmers have cultivated the dry
spots in these marshes. At twilight we came to some places
where the canal crosses Seneca River; and at eight o'clock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>were at the mouth of that river, over which a long wooden
bridge is built for the horses that tow the boats.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 3rd July, we came to the neighbourhood
of Syracuse, in Onondago County, which is traversed
by Onondago Creek, and was formerly the abode of
the numerous Indian tribe of that name, which was one
of the six nations.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> It is now cultivated; the soil is fruitful,
and thriving towns have arisen in various parts. This
tract was purchased from the Indians, and part of it settled
by them. Syracuse is a place of some importance; it is
usually denominated a village, but it certainly looks as if
it were entitled to the appellation of town. Twenty years
ago there was one solitary dwelling on this spot; now there
are 500 houses, among which are some large buildings,
several churches, a large inn, a court-house, prison, bank,
and many respectable shops.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> All the environs are strongly
impregnated with salt, and there are saline springs, from
whence a great quantity of salt is obtained. The salt water
is conducted for about {500} a mile from the springs at
Salina to the vicinity of Syracuse, where it is evaporated
by the sun in shallow vessels, and the salt crystallized. The
works are to the north of Syracuse.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>As several roads and canals cross at this place, we had
to wait for passengers, especially for the packets from Lake
Oswego, which is now navigated by steam-boats. During
this interval we viewed the traces of the extensive fire which
had taken place in the preceding spring. Though many
buildings have been rebuilt in a better style than before,
the marks of the fire are everywhere to be seen. To the
southwest of Syracuse there is an extensive valley, bounded
by wooded eminences, in which many neat villages are seen;
among them one called Onondago Hill, erected upon a verdant
rising, is worthy of notice, the remnants of the Onondago
Indians being settled here. It is reckoned to be eight
miles from Syracuse to the spot where the chief town, Onondago,
lay. Here they had their council fires, and here the
powerful and warlike nation deliberated on public affairs,
resolved upon war, concluded peace, &amp;c. Onondago Hill
is said to be a neat town, and was formerly the seat of the
courts of justice, which, however, are now removed to Syracuse.
At the latter place we saw several Onondago Indians,
who do not much differ from the Senecas and Tuscaroras;
their costume is exactly similar, and the women were also
wrapped in white blankets.</p>

<p>After some delay, our boat pursued its voyage, and I saw
large tracts of land entirely covered with the stumps of woods
that had been cleared; others with the remains of stems
burnt black, which present a singular, unattractive sight.
The dry heights are covered with pine, of which the inhabitants
affirm that six different sorts are here found&mdash;the
hemlock, the spruce, the white, the yellow, the Norway,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>and the pitch pine, the two latter of which grow on
barren grounds.</p>

<p>We took on board a great number of passengers at
Syracuse, so that our boat was crowded to excess; yet the
arrangements for the accommodation of so many people
of every description, and of both sexes, were extremely
judicious and well contrived.</p>

<p>Beyond the village of Manlius I observed thickets of
<i>Arbor vit&aelig;</i>, especially in marshy spots, where pines flourish.
After passing Chittenango Creek we came to the village of
the same name; and an hour later to Canastote, a large
village with new houses, and a couple of churches. The
few fields of wheat in the vicinity were not yet ripe. At
noon we were in the village of Oneida, which is irregularly
built on both sides of the canal.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Here we happened to
meet with above 100 Oneida Indians, whose lands, assigned
to them by the government, lie to the south of this place.
The women wore round black felt hats; the men red woollen
scarfs over their blue great coats. Their complexion was
a yellowish-brown, not dark. They were of low stature,
especially the women, as has been observed of all the remnants
of the six nations, and have retained more of the national
features than the men. We were informed that some
of these people were to embark here and proceed to Green
Bay, near which they intended to settle.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> They lived hith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>erto
{501} twelve or fifteen miles from this place, scattered
on their plantations, and their settlement is usually called
a village, though the dwellings are all isolated. Here stands
a building, commonly called Oneida Castle, where they
discuss the affairs of their tribe, and the Council Grove,
a spot with lofty old trees, under which the Oneidas assemble
on important occasions. They now meet every year
at Oneida Castle, on the 6th of June, form a circle in Council
Grove, every family by itself, and the agents of the government
pay seven dollars to each of them, because they
sold their land to the United States. The counties of Oneida
and Madison comprise the former abode of the Oneidas,
but they now live in this part of the country, having sold a
portion of their land to the United States. Of all the tribes
of the six nations, they were the only one who remained
faithful to the Americans in the early wars.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>From Oneida we soon came to Verona, a small village,
where there is a manufactory of window glass, to the south
of Lake Oneida, to which it was intended to make a canal
from this place. At two we arrived at the little village of
New London, in a country abounding with hemlock pines.
Large quantities of timber, planks, logwood, &amp;c., are sawn
here, and shipped in flat-bottomed canal boats.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Five
miles from New London is Rome, at a small distance from
the canal; it is a considerable place, with five churches,
which are seen from a distance.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The country round is
an extensive plain, through which the Mohawk flows, and
is bounded by forests in the horizon. The canal then
traverses the village of Oriskany, on Oriskany Creek, which
was one of the principal abodes of the Oneida nation.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing through a rich, verdant country, adorned with
pleasant habitations and fine forests, illumined with the
most cheerful sunshine, we came, at six o'clock in the
afternoon, to White's Town, a neat and thriving place
on the left bank of the canal, founded by a person of the
name of White, who, as the first settler, gave his name
to the town, and whose grandson, Mr. Henry White, was
on board our boat.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> On the right of the canal stands the
great cotton manufactory of Mr. Marshall, of New York,
which forms an entire village;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> two similar establishments
are in the immediate neighbourhood, and it appears that
there are at least twelve cotton manufactories on Sacquit
Creek, which falls into the Mohawk. When Mr. White
settled here, this large tract of country was inhabited by
the Oneida Indians, whose chief, Skenandoah, kept up a
very good understanding with the new settlers. This was
the scene of the event already recorded by other travellers,
when Mr. White entrusted them with his eldest daughter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>at that time a child two years old, because they had conceived
a particular affection for her. In the sequel, the
family were uneasy about the fate of the child, but the Indians
brought her back, loaded with presents, and were
delighted at this proof of confidence.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The country about White's Town, and, in fact, the whole
valley of the Mohawk, is picturesque and beautiful, and
is unquestionably the most pleasant that I have yet seen
in North America. On every side there are neat, cheerful
towns, manufactories, corn, saw, gypsum, and other mills,
in the latter of which, the gypsum, which is piled up on
the banks of the canal {502} in large grey blocks, is ground
to manure the fields. This country was formerly inhabited
by the Mohawks, who, being friends to the English, removed,
and settled in Canada.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>At Utica,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> a large town with regular streets and good
houses, there was a brisk traffic, and the servants of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>inns crowded about the boats to receive the passengers;
but I proceeded on the voyage, and enjoyed the fine scenery,
the Mohawk meandering, between lofty trees, through the
extensive verdant valley. During the night we passed German
Flats, which was originally cultivated by Germans,
whose descendants still live here, and whose language is
spoken by many settlers near the canal.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> We passed through
Canajoharie, and on the 4th of July still followed the valley
of the Mohawk, which had much increased in breadth.
In the river, the navigation of which is now transferred to
the canal, there are beautiful islands covered with poplar,
willow, and other thickets, and a covered bridge crosses it
at Amsterdam, a place consisting of about 100 tolerably
good houses, from which it is sixteen miles to Schenectady,
where, having passed Rotterdam during dinner, we arrived
at three in the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Schenectady, where the passengers quit the boats to
proceed by the railway to Albany, is a considerable place.
Carriages stood ready to convey the passengers to the railway,
and we entered them without delay. They are long
and roomy, contain many passengers, and run on ten small
wheels. One horse drew each carriage for 200 paces towards
an eminence, where it was taken off, and the carriages
fastened to a rope, and drawn up by a steam-engine.
On the eminence, the whole train, with the closed carriages
for the luggage of the passengers on the river, is connected
with the steam-engine, and in about an hour we arrived
at Albany, sixteen miles distant.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>It was early in the afternoon when we reached Albany,
a large town with 26,000 inhabitants, the capital and seat
of government of the state of New York, on the bank of
the fine, large River Hudson. I will not repeat what may
be found in every American hand-book for travellers, but
only observe, that it was the Day of Independence, one
of the great festivals in America, which was interesting to
us, because it was on that day (the 4th of July) two years
before, that I landed on the American coast. We heard
some firing, and now and then cannon were discharged in
the streets, and sky-rockets and fireworks displayed. Crowds
of people thronged every place. An introduction from Dr.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>Pitcher, with whom I had travelled on the Erie Canal,
procured me the interesting acquaintance of Dr. Edwin
James, author of the account of Major Long's "Expedition
to the Rocky Mountains," who is well known in the
literary world as a botanist and geologist. I found him a
singularly amiable, unassuming person, and passed the evening
very agreeably in his family circle. He is at present
engaged on the Indian languages, especially that of the
Chippeways, among which people he resided for a long
time.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> He had the kindness to escort me about the city,
which has many handsome buildings, some broad streets,
and in the centre a large square, round which the most important
public edifices are erected. The capitol is built
on a gentle eminence; it cost 120,000 dollars, is 115 feet
long, 90 feet wide, and 60 feet {503} high, and is adorned
on the east front with four Ionic columns. The academy,
which cost 92,000 dollars, and the city hall, built of white
marble, likewise stand in this square. The square itself
is laid out very tastefully, covered with greensward, and
intersected with broad walks, and is a great ornament to
the town.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 5th of July we
embarked in the Albany steamer for New York. The
Hudson or North River is even here a fine broad stream,
with picturesque banks, but soon widens considerably: my
navigation of it is unquestionably the most agreeable voyage
that I made in America. The distance, which is 144
miles (by land 160 miles), is conveniently performed in
one day, though it is often accomplished in twelve or fourteen
hours. The steam navigation is very brisk on the
river, except in winter, when it is impeded by the ice. The
steamers on the Hudson are very large, and no such acci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>dents
occur as on the Mississippi and the Ohio, because
only low pressure engines are employed.</p>

<p>The Albany was a large vessel, of the size of a frigate,
with three decks, of which the upper one was covered by
an awning. The middle deck was eighty paces in length;
the lower space contained three very elegantly furnished
cabins&mdash;the two at the back for the ladies, and, in front,
the large cabin or dining-room, which was adorned with
oil paintings. Our proud vessel glided swiftly down the
stream, and the beautiful banks speedily vanished from
our view. After proceeding thirty miles, we reached the
town of Hudson, opposite the Catskill Mountains, a picturesque
range, with fine summits, such as are seldom seen
in North America. This range is also called Catsbergs;
the highest summit is near Greene, eight or ten miles distant
from the river. Along the shore, at the foot of this
range, lies the village of Catskill, on Catskill Creek, which
runs through the village, and flows into the Hudson. Here
we landed, and took in some passengers, who, in token of
their having come from those more elevated regions, brought
in their hands large bunches of the beautiful kalmia blossoms.
The village contains about 350 houses and 5000
inhabitants. I would recommend the view of the Catskill
Mountains to every landscape painter.</p>

<p>Lower down, the character of the banks of the river has
much similarity with that of Italian Switzerland; bright
verdant plains alternate with the loveliest woods; while numerous
little vessels, especially schooners, glide swiftly on
the bosom of the river, which is double the width of our
Rhine; and many steamers (among them the colossal Champlain,
with four chimneys), towing large flat boats filled
with passengers, added greatly to the animation of the scene.
After dinner we lay-to at Newbury. Below this, rounded
hills covered with wood appear along the shore, not unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the Rhenish. The river now runs through a narrow, picturesque
gorge, almost shut in by the verdant hills. On the
western coast lies West Point, where the military academy
of the United States is situated; below this, the country
grows more open and flat, and the river becomes very broad
and majestic. We passed the large house of correction at
Singsing, on the eastern coast, and arrived at New York
before evening.</p>

<p>{504} We rejoiced to find the town in a perfectly healthy
state, and all our friends well. On the 8th of July I visited
Philadelphia, which can now be easily accomplished
by means of the railway from Amboy. At Bordentown we
went on board the Philadelphia steamer, and reached that
town at five in the afternoon. Our two days' stay here
was devoted to visiting friends; and I am indebted to
Professor Harlan for introducing me to Mr. Duponceau, a
learned investigator of the Indian languages, as well as
for taking me to several collections of natural history.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
The museum of the society of natural sciences contains
many interesting curiosities, among which I may mention
Dr. Morton's collection of skulls.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> In the museum of Mr.
Titian Peale I saw many objects which deserve close
investigation.</p>

<p>Early on the 11th of July we re-embarked on board the
Burlington for Bordentown; thence by railway to Amboy,
and returned to New York by the Swan steamer. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>we found an accumulation of business, consequent upon
our approaching voyage to Europe; Messrs. Gebhard and
Schuchart, however, very kindly gave us every assistance,
and greatly helped to expedite our affairs. I again spent
a most pleasant day at the country-house of Mr. Schmid,
the Prussian consul, where I had the gratification of seeing
Mr. Astor, so justly esteemed in the fur countries.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> There
was a great uproar at this time in the streets of New York;
the mob attacked the negroes, and some clergymen, who
took their part, had their windows broken and houses demolished.
Towards evening, the militia paraded the streets,
and occupied different posts, in order to check these riots.
Dr. Julius gives an account of this assault upon the negroes
in New York, page 369.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>We engaged berths on board the packet-boat Havre, Captain
Stoddart; it belongs to the Havre Line, whose vessels
are from 400 to 600 tons burden, and go every week, in
winter as well as in summer. The arrangements are particularly
good, the table capital, with abundance of fresh
milk and meat every day.</p>

<p>As the packet was to leave on the 16th of July, our collections,
&amp;c., were put on board on the 15th, and we bade
our friends and acquaintances farewell. At ten o'clock on
the day fixed for our departure we went, accompanied by
many friends, on board the Rufus King steamer, which
received her passengers on the North River Pier, and conveyed
them in twenty minutes to the packet, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>lying in the fine harbour near the city. The anchor was
already weighed, and the pilot on board. As soon as the
baggage of the several passengers was disposed of in the
hold, the Havre spread all her sails, but the wind being very
faint, it was eleven o'clock before we were opposite the
lighthouse of Statenland, which lay on our right hand, and
the batteries of Long Island on our left. The wind soon
became quite contrary, and we were obliged to cast anchor
and take in our sails: several steam-boats passed us, and
we wanted them to take us in tow, but, to our great vexation,
they refused to stop. Towards evening, however,
the wind rose a little, and we tacked slowly towards the
sea.</p>

<p>{505} At six in the morning of the 17th of July we lay opposite
Sandy Hook, a little above the lighthouse. At half-past
twelve we saw, at a distance on the left hand, Fire Island
lighthouse, which is forty miles from Sandy Hook; and on
the 18th we lost sight of the coast. Our voyage was on the
whole favourable: we did not pass over the bank of Newfoundland,
but on the 24th and 25th of July were very far to
the south of it. We afterwards had a fresh and favourable
wind, and followed the track of the Columbia, (as laid down
in the charts), which performed the voyage from Portsmouth
to New York in fifteen days.</p>

<p>On the 30th of July we made 5&deg; in twenty-four hours.
The sight of the numerous vessels which passed us full sail
was very striking, and greatly cheered the whole of the ship's
company. We proceeded at the rate of nine or ten knots an
hour; the wind was favourable, and, though very strong,
even our topmost sails were spread, an experiment which
other nations do not often venture upon; but the Americans
are very bold seamen. On the 2nd of August we were to
the north of the Azores, which I had seen in 1817, and on
the following day spoke the brig Helen Douglas, from Ham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>burgh,
and communicated reciprocally our longitude and
latitude. We overtook several ships, which the Havre soon
left far behind her.</p>

<p>Our people endeavoured to harpoon some dolphins, but
the handle of the instrument, which was admirably contrived,
soon broke.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>At <i>a</i> there is a joint; <i>b</i> is a movable ring; <i>d</i> is the sharp
edge of the instrument; <i>f</i> the back, which is blunt. When
the point <i>e</i> is forced into the body of the animal, it penetrates
so far, that the resistance of the body moves the ring <i>b</i>; the
whole head springs from the position in which it was held by
the ring; the edge <i>d</i> continues to act in an horizontal direction,
and the point <i>c</i> forms a barb by which the instrument
remains fixed in the animal.</p>

<p>On the 6th of August we overtook the Congress, a large
ship bound from New Orleans to Liverpool, which had come
thus far in forty-eight days. We soon got the start of her,
and on the following day were already in the channel, having
passed Cape Lizard in the night. At three in the afternoon
land was descried from the mast-head; it was the
Island of Guernsey: we then saw Alderney, and afterwards
Cape la Hogue on the French coast, very clearly. The
wind became more fresh every moment, and, twilight setting
in, we greatly desired to obtain a pilot. At length we
saw a boat contending with the waves, which, with considerable
exertion, brought us a pilot from Havre. We sailed
in the dark, passed the lighthouse at Cherbourg, and afterwards
saw that of Harfleur, our ship running seven or eight
knots an hour.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 8th of August we were off
Havre de Grace, with a violent head {506} wind, and waited
for the proper time to enter, which, as in many ports in the
channel, can only be done at high water. We were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
more impatient for this moment, as the wind continued to
increase, and threatened to rise to a storm. Large ships
from Martinique and Guadaloupe, under French colours,
shared the same trial of patience with ourselves. At length,
after ten o'clock, the pilot gave the signal&mdash;the sails were
spread, and the Havre hastened to enter the port. A great
crowd of people was assembled on the pier, and breakers
raged at the narrow mouth of the harbour; however, we
soon felt the effect of the mole which human art has opposed
to the fury of the elements, and at half-past eleven o'clock
the Havre cast anchor in Europe.</p>

was not until 1803, although saw and grist mills had been built some years earlier,

Perinton, named for its first settler, Glover Perrin (about 1790), had little

there were but nine houses there, seven of which were log-cabins, at the opening
of the canal (1822). It numbered in 1900, 2,439.

the immense Lake Superior, the area of which is estimated at 30,000 square miles,
to the small lakes only a few miles in length, their forms differ entirely, and are
in part highly picturesque. These lakes and rivers have been judiciously suffered
to retain their ancient harmonious Indian names; whereas the Americans have,
in general, transferred the names of European towns and districts to this land,
where we often meet with excessively dissonant, inappropriate names, which frequently
call forth a smile, as Dr. Julius very justly observes, Vol. I. p. 420.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span>

Webster, coming from New England, built a trading post in 1786. It was included
in the salt reservation established in 1797 and offered for sale by the state in 1804.
The first purchaser was Abraham Walton, who built a mill upon the site the following
year. Walton intended to found a village, but not until the establishment of the
canal did Syracuse outgrow its embryonic stage. Meanwhile several names had
been in use; Milan was suggested in 1809; South Salina was used for three years
(1809-12); Corinth was desired, but a Corinth post-office already existing, Syracuse
was suggested, because of a certain resemblance to the site of the famous Sicilian
city. Organized as a village in 1825, Syracuse finally became a city in 1847.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

century. By 1770, salt from this region was an article of barter among
Indian tribes. The first made by white men was in 1788; primitive methods were
followed, however, until in 1797 the state set apart a reservation of thirteen thousand
acres, embracing the saline springs, and the next year manufacture on a large scale
was begun. Although much of the land was afterwards sold by the state, control
of the salines was maintained by the government for a hundred years; in 1898,
however, the state finding participation in this manufacture unprofitable, the springs
became private property.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

lived east of the Onondaga, in the present Madison and Oneida counties. In 1788
they ceded their land to New York state, retaining a large reservation, which has
been gradually disposed of for successive annuities. About 1820 the project of
their removal to Wisconsin was broached, and two delegations representing diverse
interests among the Oneida, headed respectively by Dr. Jedidiah Morse, and
Reverend Eleazer Williams, visited the West, and entered into arrangements with
the Menominee and Winnebago tribes for territory contiguous to Green Bay.
These treaties were the subjects of much negotiation, but the controversy was finally
settled (1831) by the United States government in favor of the New York Indians.
With the Oneida were three tribes of New England Indians&mdash;the Stockbridge,
Munsee, and Brothertown&mdash;who had previously been (in the latter part of the
eighteenth century) received among the Oneida in New York. The migration
of these various tribes began about 1823, and continued at varying intervals until
about 1846, a small remnant only remaining in New York. In Wisconsin they
located permanently; the Munsee and Brothertown having assumed citizenship,
are for the most part absorbed in the white population of Brown, Outagamie, and
Calumet counties, chiefly the last named, although a few are mingled with the
Oneida on their reservation near Green Bay. The latter number about two thousand,
and are in a fairly prosperous condition, chiefly farmers. On the Stockbridge
reservation in Shawano County there are about five hundred engaged in
farming and lumbering. Consult <i>Wisconsin Historical Collections</i>, ii, pp. 415-449;

Township, Madison County, on the borders of Oneida County. At this village
Reverend Samuel Kirkland established himself as a missionary in 1766, and it
was chiefly due to his influence that the main body of the Oneida remained neutral
during the Revolutionary War. After the removal to Wisconsin a few of the
tribe clung to their original home, and about a hundred and fifty are still to be

and waters flowing into Lake Ontario. As early as 1756 the English had erected
Fort Bull at the western extremity of the portage, but this was promptly captured
and destroyed by French troops. Two years later, Fort Stanwix was erected by
the British general of that name; the cost was $60,000, and the fort was heavily
garrisoned until the close of the French and Indian War. In 1768 the famous
treaty with the Iroquois, making a great land cession to the English colonies
took place at this outpost. At the outbreak of the Revolution the name of the
fort was changed to Schuyler, and the next year (1777) it was besieged by Major
Barry St. Leger with a force of Indian allies; the post was finally relieved by General
Benedict Arnold. The first settler near the fort was a German, Johann
Reuff (or Roof). He fled at the time of the siege, and the place was without
inhabitants until 1785-87, when New England colonists began to arrive. The
site of Rome was purchased by a New York merchant named Lynch who laid
out a town (1796) and called it Lynchburg; this was later changed for the classic
cognomen, and the village of Rome incorporated in 1819.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

of a confiscated Tory patent known as Sadequahada, he being the first settler west
of German Flats, on the Mohawk. Coming out to his purchase in 1784, with his
entire family of sons and sons-in-law, he settled what was for a time known as
Whitestown, whither a number of Connecticut relatives and friends followed in
succeeding years. Judge White was a man of ability and much physical strength.
He attained considerable influence with the Oneida, who adopted him into their
tribe. Dying in 1812, he left many descendants. Originally known as Whitestown,
the village surrendered that title to the township, and was incorporated (1811)
as Whitehall Landing, a name changed two years later to Whitesborough. The
Oneida Historical Society in 1884 celebrated the centennial of the founding of this
place by erecting a granite shaft upon the village green. Whitesborough at one

York in large numbers in 1710, and began to settle as early as 1712 on land
patented to them by the Mohawk. The settlement was for many years the outpost
of the Mohawk Valley, and thus was sadly harassed in Indian wars. In November,
1757, French and Indians led by Belestre fell upon the village, carried away
captive many of its inhabitants, and burned the entire settlement. A similar fate
befell the place in 1778, when the Mohawk chief Brant advanced against this valley,
and continued attacks were maintained by his people until the close of the
war. The Germans were loyal to the American cause, and under General Nicholas
Herkimer formed the bulk of the army that won the day at Oriskany. About
1784 there was a large influx of new settlers of American stock. The chief town
of the settlement is now known as Herkimer, with a population of about six thousand.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

an Englishman of some eminence, who had married an American and

conceived the idea, as early as 1825, of uniting Albany and Schenectady
by a railway. The next year a company was incorporated, whose president was
Stephen Van Rensselaer. Delay was incident upon construction, and the line was not
opened until August, 1831, when the locomotive "Detroit Clinton" drew a train
of carriages from Albany to Schenectady. The Mohawk and Albany Railway
was the progenitor of the present New York Central and Hudson River Railway.

<h2>I. VOCABULARIES OF SOME OF THE TRIBES
OF NORTHWESTERN AMERICA, WITH AN
ACCOUNT OF THE INDIAN SIGN LANGUAGE</h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Much has been written by scholars in recent times on the
Asiatic extraction of the American peoples; and the attempt
has been made, particularly in the United States, to prove
such a relationship. This exceedingly interesting subject
opens to the investigator a boundless field; but one whose
paths are dark and difficult to make clear. Many good
reasons can be given for an Asiatic descent of the Americans;
on the other hand, objections can be made which cannot
easily be set aside. In either case strikingly similar
traits have been found in the peoples of the two continents,
as may be seen from Delafield's new work, where everything
that can be said on the subject has been brought together.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>As the traveller stands in front of the long lines of the old
Indian burial mound near St. Louis, he can easily believe
that he has before him one of the south Russian kurgans.
Moreover, surprising correspondences are found from a
comparison of the works of art, as well as the intellectual
and moral characteristics, of the peoples of Mexico and
Peru with those of India and Egypt. But we search in
vain for Mongols in North America. When one has seen
the Hindoos, Kalmucks, Bashkirs, and Chinese, he will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that the features and complexion of the type of man now
inhabiting North America are very different from those of
the Asiatic peoples; and will feel justified in regarding the
Americans as a distinct race.</p>

<p>The most firmly-grounded objections to the theory of the
Asiatic extraction of the Americans seems to lie in the difference
in the color of the skin and in the slight relationship
of the languages; for the few words related to American,
which have so far been sought out with great difficulty in
the Asiatic languages, do not appear to have much weight.</p>

<p>D'Orbigny<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> assumes that there are different races among
the peoples of America. But even if it is necessary, for
the sake of clearness, to make various subdivisions in such
an extended and varied population, on the basis of distinguishing
characteristics, nevertheless such a division is difficult
and arbitrary. If representatives of all these peoples
could be brought together, a classification would present
fewer difficulties; but great distances often separate related
tribes, and memory rarely suffices for making these exact
comparisons. I cannot render a decision on D'Orbigny's
supposition that in the American branch of humanity
the North Americans form a different race from the South
Americans, since I have become acquainted with only a
small number of the South American nations.</p>

<p>One claim, which seems to me to have decided probability,
is that the ancient Mexicans migrated from the more
northern parts of the continent of America. There are
many indications of this. The hieroglyphic painting of the
migration of the people, which later rose to a higher culture
in Mexico, which was discovered by Boturini and brought
out by Delafield, is, from this standpoint, a highly interesting
document.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The drawings of the present North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>American Indians still show many similarities to those of
old Mexican pictures, although it must be said that they
are much rougher, cruder, and more childish.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Therein,
also, foot prints are represented when it is desired to show
a continued movement of the figures; and other correspondences
have already been pointed out. In various
places in the account of my travels, I have sought to call
attention to them and to the conjectured southward
migration of the Americans. The skulls, however, which
have been taken from the old burial grounds on the
Wabash, do not show that flattening of the heads that is
portrayed on Delafield's first plate; but their crowns are
rounded just as nature formed them.</p>

<p>All conjectures over the origin and relationship of these
peoples must await the more trustworthy conclusions which
it will be justifiable to draw from the relationship of their
languages; only through more exact knowledge of them can
we hope to make progress in this broad and obscure field.
Several of the North American dialects are already fairly
well known to philologists; for a majority of the rest there
are, at least, vocabularies which allow a superficial classification
according to relationship. Distinguished American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
philologists, Duponceau, Pickering,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Edwin James, Gallatin,
and several others have accumulated much material, but
there has been no comprehensive work on the subject. This
lack has in part been filled by Mr. Albert Gallatin, whose
learned work is in the hands of the publishers.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Since
at the present time the attention of travellers is being
directed more and more to this highly interesting subject,
these materials are likely to be largely increased in the near
future, and to give American scholars the chance of constantly
perfecting their work. Some authors, among them
McKenney, in his <i>History of the Indian Tribes of North
America</i>,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> do not seem to attach much value to vocabularies
collected by travellers. To be sure, these often are
handled in a thoughtless and superficial manner; but it
must be remembered that in the interior of North America
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>excellent interpreters of the Indian languages may now be
found, and that the Indians themselves often fluently speak
several languages. Through these agencies interesting contributions
to our knowledge of the dialects referred to may
always be expected.</p>

<p>In an examination of the tribes of America, the multiplicity
of their languages is very striking. These languages
are often confined to quite small tribes; their origin is quite
correctly explained by Mr. Gallatin.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> From the interesting
work of this scholar it appears, however, that a certain similarity
of character belongs to this multitude of tongues&mdash;a
circumstance that testifies to their common origin as well
as to the antiquity of the American population.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> All this
material thus gains value in the eyes of the philologist; and
in this connection it is with pleasure to be noticed, that
with the extension of these investigations the interest in
them in America constantly brings forward diligent co-operators.</p>

<p>Such work would be far easier and much more useful if
all the vocabularies were compiled and copied on the same
principles. Most of those in existence have been written
down by Englishmen, or Anglo-Americans; and as a rule
they, like the French, cannot, as Gallatin admits, correctly
reproduce the Indian gutturals;<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> yet it is characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>of all these languages that they abound in gutturals. Another
defect in the usual vocabularies, lies in the omission
of accents; for these, also, are peculiarly characteristic of
the American languages. One of the dialects which I investigated
is so difficult to write, that even after the
greatest effort I could reproduce but a few words&mdash;I refer
to that of the Grosventres of the prairies, sometimes
called by the English Fall Indians.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> For this tongue,
even the fur trade company had not been able to find an
interpreter; and was compelled to carry on all business
with those Indians in the Blackfoot language. Most of the
other languages of the Missouri Valley can more easily be
reproduced by the Germans and Dutch than by other
nations; because, as has already been explained, their own
speech abounds in gutturals and regularly has hard endings.
Consequently the English vocabularies for these tribes
are always more or less defective. Pickering felt this very
decidedly, and has consequently proposed for his countrymen
a notation of tones which is analogous to the German,
and which, if it comes into use, will produce most beneficial
results. Pickering's scheme requires that the vowels be
pronounced in America as follows:</p>


<ul><li><i>a</i> as in the word <i>father</i>,</li>
<li><i>e</i> as in <i>there</i>,</li>
<li><i>i</i> as in <i>machine</i>,</li>
<li><i>o</i> as in <i>note</i>,</li>
<li><i>u</i> as in <i>rule</i>,</li>
<li><i>y</i> as in <i>you</i> (or as <i>ee</i> in English).</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, he adopts the German system, completely. In
place of the German <i>&aelig;</i> and <i>&#339;</i>, or <i>&auml;</i> and <i>&ouml;</i>, he proposes to
write in English <i>a<sup>e</sup></i> and <i>o<sup>e</sup></i>; in place of <i>c</i> to use <i>k</i>, a change
that will avoid many misunderstandings; and when the
pronunciation is hard, to use <i>z</i>, etc. If this system had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
used earlier, a smaller number of errors would have crept
into the works on this subject, and into the translations
from one language to another. For instance, my vocabularies
of the Brazilian peoples have in places been very
incorrectly reproduced by French translators.</p>

<p>Another defect in the usual English system, for such vocabularies,
arises from the division of all words into syllables,
a method which Duponceau very rightly censured;
for in this way the correct pronunciation of the words is
generally lost. When the word with its accents has been
written as a whole, the division into syllables is the next
task, in order thus to reach conclusions regarding its inflection
and derivation&mdash;something quite indispensable for the
philologist. A word divided in the English style into its
component parts, could be correctly pronounced neither by
a German nor by a Frenchman; besides, every language
has its own intonation, not common to others. I have,
therefore, held it to be the surest way of making the Indian
words intelligible to all my readers, to call to my aid the
pronunciation of several nations. For instance, <i>on</i> and <i>an</i>,
in the Indian languages are spoken, sometimes as in German,
sometimes as in French; in such cases I have noted
in a parenthesis the system according to which the word
or syllable is to be pronounced. Other notes of this character
have seemed necessary, and these require the following
explanations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Sharp <i>c</i> is designated as in French by <i>&ccedil;</i>.</p>

<p>(2) Guttur. denotes guttural, <i>i.e.</i>, the German or Dutch pronunciation.</p>

<p>(3) <i>a&ordm;</i> or <i>o&ordf;</i> denotes full <i>a</i> or <i>o</i>, somewhat like <i>aw</i> in English. Here
I might have written <i>o&#865;a</i>; but by using <i>a&ordm;</i> and <i>o&ordf;</i>, I also indicate that
the sound of the lower letter predominates.</p>

<p>(4) d. d. N. (durch die Nase) denotes through the nose: <i>i.e.</i>, a nasal
sound.</p>

<p>(5) When the sign &frac12; follows a letter, it means that it is to be only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
half pronounced, somewhat as the first <i>e</i> in the German word <i>gegangen</i>,
or the second <i>e</i> in the English word <i>achievement</i>.</p>

<p>(6) I have tried to indicate the length of a syllable by adding an <i>h</i>,
a plan which I preferred to the ordinary signs &#8765; or &#9181;, since these
might easily be confused in printing.</p>

<p>(7) A <i>g</i> is often heard at the end of the syllables <i>on</i> and <i>an</i>; consequently
I have written them <i>ong</i> and <i>ang</i>. This is the German system,
as I have indicated by the word "German." It is assumed that
the philologist will be familiar, at least in general, with German as
well as with French and English pronunciation.</p>

<p>(8) As the French acute accent seemed to me entirely adequate for
indicating the correct intonation of the Indian words, I have chosen
it to show on what letter or syllable the emphasis is to be placed. Occasionally,
owing to haste or lack of time, it may have been forgotten
or omitted.</p>

<p>(9) In the case of the letter <i>j</i>, I have not followed Mr. Pickering's
scheme, for everyone knows how it is pronounced in French and in
German. When it has the former value&mdash;as very often in the American
languages&mdash;I have noted "French:" <i>i.e.</i>, pronounce as in French.
In no other way, it seems to me, can the soft French <i>j</i> be clearly indicated.</p>

<p>(10) The German guttural sound <i>ch</i>, as in the syllables <i>ach</i>, <i>och</i>,
or <i>uch</i>, is, as Gallatin observes, difficult for Englishmen and Frenchmen;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
but it occurs everywhere in the American languages, and the
reader must learn it if he wishes to pronounce such words correctly.</p>

<p>(11) The <i>r</i> is never pronounced by these peoples as a guttural, but
always with the point of the tongue against the roof of the mouth; <i>d</i>
and <i>r</i>, as well as <i>r</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>n</i>,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> are quite often interchanged, or indistinctly
pronounced.</p>

<p>(12) On the syllable <i>in</i>, I have often noted that <i>n</i> is to be pronounced
as in French: <i>i.e.</i>, the syllable <i>in</i> does not sound like <i>ain</i> in French,
but merely the <i>n</i> is pronounced as in French; the whole sound is, therefore,
almost <i>i</i> nasal, and only a little at the end sinks to <i>n</i>.</p></div>

<p>It is the duty of every traveller in distant, little-known
lands to make contributions, according to his ability, to the
knowledge of their languages; hence I have brought together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>in the following pages my own notes, however insignificant
and incomplete they may be, under the difficulties which
stand in the way of such work. The ignorance of the interpreters,
their lack of sympathy with any kind of scientific
investigation, the frequent unwillingness of the Indians
to assist, superstitious and unintelligible ideas, and lack of
time and leisure&mdash;these usually combine to make such
examinations difficult. When, here and there, I detected
some deviations from Mr. Gallatin's vocabularies, it was
my duty to record them in order to aid investigation and
come nearer the truth. The fault-finding spirit would certainly
never prompt me to this, since we are concerned
here, not with the use of the material, but with the former
method of collecting it.</p>

<p>I have written these vocabularies, in part from the pronunciation
of the Indians themselves; in part, from that of
interpreters, who are usually half-breeds, and therefore thoroughly
acquainted with the Indian as well as with the French
or English languages&mdash;they have, at least, lived for a long
time with those nations; finally, in part from the pronunciation
and with the kind assistance of the Indian agent,
Major Dougherty,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> who speaks several of these languages
fluently. From some tribes, owing to lack of time or interpreters,
I have obtained but few words; from others, more;
the most complete vocabularies are in the Mandan and
Minnitarri languages, because I passed the winter among
them. While I was living with the Mandans I undertook
something of a grammatical study of their language; but
unfortunately its continuation and completion were interrupted
by illness.</p>

<p>Since but a moment was sometimes at my disposal for
collecting a few words, I chose a list of twenty of those that
frequently occur, and asked for them first, in order to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
a comparison and draw conclusions regarding the relationship
of the tribes. These words were as follows:</p>


<ul><li>sun</li>
<li>moon</li>
<li>star</li>
<li>god</li>
<li>fire</li>
<li>water</li>
<li>earth</li>
<li>man</li>
<li>woman</li>
<li>child</li>
<li>head</li>
<li>arm</li>
<li>hand</li>
<li>hair</li>
<li>eye</li>
<li>mouth</li>
<li>bow</li>
<li>arrow</li>
<li>tobacco pipe</li>
<li>tomahawk</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of the vocabularies I have noted the source from
which it was obtained. The order in which the tribes are
arranged is not according to linguistic relationship, but
alphabetical for the sake of easier reference.</p>

<p>From an examination of the following examples of the
languages of twenty-three peoples it appears, as is observed
by the Rev. Dr. Reck, a philologist,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> that the Sauki, Musquake,
Kickapuh, Ojibua, and Krih tribes belong together&mdash;a
circumstance that has long been known. The speech
of the Wasaji [Osage], Konsa, Oto, Omaha, Punca, Dacota,
Assiniboin, and Mandan tribes appear to be only dialects
of the Dacota (Sioux) linguistic group, of which the
last, which I can give most completely, has been but little
known. The ten remaining tribes seem to be more foreign
to one another&mdash;only between the Blackfoot and Snake
(Shoshone) dialects, do we find word relationships. There
are likewise many similarities between the Mandan and
Minnitarri languages; but these, as I was repeatedly assured,
arose only after the two peoples had lived near each other,
as I have already related elsewhere in the account of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>travels. The name of the deity is "manito" among the
Musquake [Fox], Sauki, Kickapuh, Ojibua, and Krih tribes,
all of which belong to the Algonkin, or Algic linguistic
group; among the seven tribes of the Dacota group, it is
"wakonda," or "wakanda," which has the same or a similar
meaning in half of the tribes mentioned. The word
for water is very similar among most of these people, and
the name of the tobacco pipe is the same or similar in half
of the dialects.</p>

<p>First and last, various corrections have been made in
these lists; yet they remain incomplete, and further observation
will add many new corrections. I must, therefore,
as always, request consideration from learned critics.
Finally, I must note that if in the body of my narrative
some words are not written as in the vocabularies, the
spelling of the latter is to be preferred.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

Mexico in 1736 on a mission for a descendant of Montezuma. Becoming interested
in Mexican antiquities, Boturini spent eight years in making a valuable collection
of aboriginal manuscripts; but having incurred the suspicion of the government,
he was imprisoned and his collection confiscated (1745). On his return voyage
to Spain, whither he was sent for trial, the galley was captured by the English, and
the last vestiges of his antiquities disappeared. In Spain he sought redress, which
was granted him, but this of course did not restore his collection. While in Spain
he published <i>Idea de una nueva historia general de la America septentrionale</i> (Madrid,
1746), in which appears a catalogue of this collection. A portion was recovered,
and is now in the museum in the City of Mexico. The manuscript seen by Delafield

John, eldest son of Timothy Pickering, the Massachusetts statesman, was born
at Salem in 1777; being graduated from Harvard (1796), he began the study of
law at Philadelphia, where his father was in residence as a member of the federal
cabinet. The following year, however, John went to Portugal as legation secretary,
being transferred to the embassy at London, where he remained until 1801.
Returning to Salem, he again devoted himself to the legal profession, also to linguistic
studies which he had diligently pursued abroad, making contributions to
Greek philology, and publishing a lexicon of that language. He was offered chairs
of both Hebrew and Greek at Harvard, but declined, preferring to live in Boston,
whither he removed in 1829. His interest in North American linguistics was
awakened (1819) by Duponceau's work, and the following year he published an
"Essay on a Uniform Orthography for the Indian Languages of North America,"
in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences <i>Transactions</i>, iv. He also edited,
with copious notes, John Eliot's <i>Indian Grammar</i>, Jonathan Edwards's <i>Observations
on the Mohegan Language</i>, and Father Sebastian Rasle's <i>Dictionary of the
Abnaki Tongue</i>; and prepared the article on North American languages for the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Americana</i>. Pickering was a member of many learned societies,
at one time being president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and
was granted the degree of LL. D. by both Bowdoin (1822) and Harvard (1835).
His death occurred at Boston in 1846.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p></div>

the other hand, the great extent of ground necessary to sustain game sufficient for
the subsistence of a very moderate population, compels them (the Indians) to separate
and to form a number of small independent communities. It may easily be perceived
that the perpetual state of warfare, in which neighboring tribes are engaged,
had its origin in the same cause which has produced the great diversity of American
languages or dialects. We may also understand how the affections of the Indian
became so exclusively concentrated in his own tribe, the intensity of that natural
feeling, how it degenerated into deadly hatred of hostile nations, and the excesses
of more than savage ferocity, in which he indulged under the influence of his unrestrained
vindictive passions."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian</span>.</p></div>

his attention to historical and linguistic pursuits. Educated under a brother of
Emanuel Kant, he studied at G&ouml;ttingen with Professor Johann Friedrich Blumenbach,
who later gave an impetus to Maximilian's investigations. About 1785 Recke
retired to Mitau where for over forty years he was state archivist, with leisure to
pursue his special investigations. As a philologist his fame rests on his <i>Allgemeinen
Schriftsteller und gelehrten Lexikons der provinzen Livland, Esthland, und Kurland</i>
(Mitau, 1827-32). It would appear that Maximilian consulted Dr. Recke upon
the analogies of his Indian vocabularies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_237_237" id="Footnote_237_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_237_237"><span class="label">[237]</span></a> In transcribing the Indian words of these vocabularies, the word divisions
and diacritical marks of the German edition have been copied exactly as they stand,
save when the division of a word at the end of a line has necessitated an additional
hyphen. Most of the diacritical marks are explained by the author in his introduction.
The vertical accent seems to be used to indicate secondary, or less emphatic
stress; the horizontal superior &deg; appears, likewise, to be used to show that the
sound is less prominent than when the usual superior &deg; is used.
</p>
<p>
Exact translation of the German words has been very difficult in some cases,
owing to the entire absence of context. The parentheses following the English
contain alternative or explanatory words. Some of these are given by Maximilian
himself, some lie in the form of the German word, and some are supplied by the
translator.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Translator</span>.</p>

for the most part, incorrectly written. We find, for instance, that in the word
<i>pistachkan</i> the copyist avoided the guttural sound and wrote <i>pistarkan</i>. I must
also remark here that Townsend in his <i>Narrative of a Journey across the Rocky
Mountains to the Columbia River</i>, speaks in very exaggerated terms of the Blackfoot
Indians. This is due to the fact that his information came from trappers and
fur hunters who usually have the greatest respect for those Indians who are their
bitterest enemies. On the other hand, what Townsend says of the injustice of
the fur hunters towards these Indians is thoroughly justified.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span>

of the treaty in the Dac&oacute;ta language is something which repeatedly occurs, since
there are frequently no interpreters for little-known nations, and recourse must be
had to the translation of other Indians. I shall instance a similar case in connection
with the Mandan language, where the signatures of a treaty were translated

He divides the Sioux into a northern and a southern group; and includes in the

great. Vail and others also very often write <i>uakan</i>, incorrectly <i>wah-kon</i>. The

Flatheads live in the Rocky mountains; and according to the missionary, Parker,
number only eight hundred souls. They are said to speak the same language as
the Ponderas [Pend d'Oreille] and Spokein [Spokan] Indians. The custom of
flattening the head by pressure is not found among them, at least at present (Townsend,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 175); but this is done by several tribes on the Columbia as is stated
also in <i>Astoria</i>. All travellers who have visited this people bear witness to their
upright and noble conduct, as well as to their piety. Like the Nez-Perc&eacute;s, of whom
the same is said, they have borrowed a number of Christian usages and beliefs,
among them the conscientious observance of Sunday (see <i>Adventures of Captain
Bonneville</i>, p. 248; and Ross Cox). They are reputed to be brave warriors; of
this I was assured by the Blackfoot Indians themselves, who are often at war with
them and are their bitterest enemies, and who also showed me many trophies taken
from them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span>

my Atlas. I have spoken of this people in several places in the first volume of this
work. Parker (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 304) says of the Kuton&auml;&#781;s, Kutneh&auml;&#781;s, or Kutanihs: "The
Cootanies inhabit a section of country to the north of the Ponderas along M'Gillivray's
river, and they are represented as an uncommonly interesting people. They
speak a language distinct from all the tribes about them, open and sonorous, and
free from gutturals, which are common in the language of the surrounding tribes.
They are neat in their persons and lodges, candid and honest, and kind to each
other. I could not ascertain their numbers, but probably they are not over a
thousand." In Ross Cox, (p. 242), there is also information regarding them; but
the missionary Parker (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 286) seems to call this traveller's truthfulness in
question. From my carefully copied words of the Kutan&auml; language, it is evident
that it is not easy to pronounce on account of its lingual clicking; and that it has
a large number of guttural tones.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_255_255" id="Footnote_255_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_255_255"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> The Kutan&auml;&#781;s, or Kutun&auml;&#781;s, also Kutneh&auml;&#781;s, dwell in the Rocky mountains
beyond the sources of Maria river; and on their mountains lives the white mountain
goat. They are said to call themselves Kutonach&auml;; the French know them
as Coutonais; and the Blackfeet call them Kutan&auml;&#781;. They are few in number,
having only some forty lodges. Among their ornaments they highly prize cylinders
cut from mussel-shells, especially those cut from the shell of the dentalium, which
they obtain from the western seacoast. The Blackfeet, especially the Blood Indians,
are their declared enemies. They do not live on the flesh of the buffalo,
which is not found in their mountains; but in their country many beaver are obtained,
excellent fish (trout), and several other species of animals, especially the
orignal (<i>cervus alces amer.</i>), the white mountain goat, and the bighorn; also many
kinds of roots and berries serve them as food. They raise large numbers of strong
and handsome horses; they are well clothed; and are expert beaver hunters. They
are skilful in making bows and arrows. Their language is difficult to learn. The
words are spoken softly and indistinctly; in addition there are many clicking tones
and hollow gutturals; and they also lisp.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="footnotes"><h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_256_256" id="Footnote_256_256"></a><a href="#FNanchor_256_256"><span class="label">[256]</span></a> I am indebted to the untiring patience of Mr. Kipp, who is thoroughly familiar
with this language, for this extensive vocabulary which I wrote down with
the help of several Mandans. My attempt at a grammar, as I have already said,
was interrupted by illness. Mr. Gallatin (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 125) includes the Mandans
with the Minnitarris; but he had no vocabulary of their language and could, therefore,
in no wise form a correct judgment. The signatures to the treaty which he
mentions (pp. 125 and 379) were translated into the Minnitarri language because
of the lack of a Mandan interpreter. This is shown clearly from the words <i>matsa</i>
(man) and <i>lahpeetzee</i>, or <i>lachpitzi</i> (bear), both of which are pure Minnitarri words.
I hope by means of the following examples of the Mandan language to refute many
of the errors regarding this people which were formerly spread abroad.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span>

<p>Remark. No difference in form is made for sex; and in the case of
human beings, appears to be only occasionally indicated by an ending.
They say: a man, num&aacute;nk-m&aacute;chana; and in exactly the same way, a
woman, mi&#781;hha-m&aacute;chana; an egg, m&aacute;h-ni&#781;hka-m&aacute;chana. The case
where the sexes are indicated is when, for instance, some one addresses
a person and tells him he should do something; if it is a man the
syllable <i>t&aacute;</i> is affixed, if a woman the syllable <i>na</i>.</p>

<h4><i>Nouns</i></h4>


<h5>Singular</h5>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><b>The old man</b>: warat&oacute;hka-chihosch (<i>ch</i> guttural).</p>

<p><b>The old woman</b>: rok&aacute;nka-chih&eacute;nn (<i>ch</i> guttural).</p>

<p><b>The fish-hook</b>: po&iuml;kini&#781;h (<i>o</i> and <i>i</i> separated).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The arm</b>: a&#781;hd&auml;.</p>

<p><b>The branch</b>: o&#781;hchancha (<i>ch</i> guttural; <i>an</i> French).</p>

<p><b>The eye</b>: ist&aacute;.</p>

<p><b>The eyelid</b>: ist&aacute;-rupch&auml;&#781;.</p>

<p><b>The axe</b>: &oacute;hmanat&auml;.</p></div>


<h5>Plural</h5>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><b>The old men</b>: warat&oacute;hka-keri&#781;sch; really ker&eacute;hsch.</p>

<p><b>The old women</b>: rok&aacute;nke-keri&#781;sh.</p>

<p><b>The fish-hooks</b>: po&iuml;kini&#781;h-ker&eacute;hsch.</p>

<p><b>The arms</b>: a&#781;hd&auml;-ker&eacute;hsch.</p>

<p><b>The branches</b>: o&#781;hchancha-ker&eacute;hsch.</p>

<p><b>The eyelids</b>: ist&aacute;-rupchi-ker&eacute;hsch.</p>

<p><b>The axes</b>: o&#781;hmanat-ker&eacute;hsch.</p>

<p><b>A great forest</b>: m&aacute;nna-ker&eacute;hsch; i.e., many trees, from m&aacute;nna, tree.</p></div>

<p>Remark. From these instances it is easy to derive the rule that to
form the plural of nouns the word ker&eacute;hsch is affixed. It is occasionally
pronounced kerisch, and denotes plurality.</p>

<p>Exceptions:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>M&aacute;hna, the year; the plural is not m&aacute;na-ker&eacute;hsch, but man&aacute;hna,
the years, or better, the winters.</p>

<p>Both arms, i.e., the arms, are called in the plural, a&#781;hd&auml;-n&aacute;hta;
the legs, d&oacute;hke-n&aacute;hta. This exception is due to the fact that
the number of arms on the body is definitely known; they are
never more than two, so the plural is "both."</p>

<p>The word ker&eacute;hsch also signifies in some few cases that objects of
only one kind are included, yet always in the plural. Thus,
when one enters a lodge where old men or women are assembled,
he would say warat&oacute;hka-ker&eacute;hsch, only old men; or rok&aacute;nka-ker&eacute;hsch,
only or merely old women; waschi&#781;-ker&eacute;hsch, merely
white men; waschipsi(<i>waschi-psih</i>)-ker&eacute;hsch, merely negroes, etc.</p></div>

</table><p>The word "from," motion towards the speaker, is expressed by t&aacute;;
as in hut&aacute;, come here. The word "to," motion from the speaker, is
expressed by the word &auml;&#781;ta.</p>

<p>Exception:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Id&auml;&#781;ta-ker&eacute;hsch, the others; in this expression ker&eacute;hsch is usually
omitted, and only id&auml;&#781;ta used.</p></div>


<h4><i>Proper Names</i></h4>

<p>The names of these Indians always have a meaning, and often include
a whole phrase. All familiar objects and their different states
are drawn upon for the names of persons, and these are often very
vulgar. I have given some of them above.</p>


<h4><i>Adjectives</i></h4>

<p>Adjectives are placed after the nouns; e.g., meni&#781;ss-sch&oacute;tt&auml;, horse
white, not as in German and English, the white horse.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Mandeck suck-s&auml; (<i>an</i> French), the red bird; i.e., bird the red.</p>

<p>Numank-ch&aacute;rak&auml; (<i>ch</i> guttural), the brave man.</p>

<p>Pass&aacute;n-schi&#781;hsch (<i>an</i> French), the beautiful river.</p>

<p>Mani&#781;ssuarut-psi&#781;hsch, the black dog.</p></div>


<h4><i>Comparison</i></h4>

<p>The comparative degree is formed by affixing the word op&aacute;chadehsch,
or op&aacute;ch&aacute;d&auml;hsch (<i>ch</i> guttural), i.e., more. The superlative
degree is formed by affixing the word mi&#781;hkasch, i.e., the most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><b>Good</b>, schihsch: better, schi&#781;h-opa&#781;chadehsch: best, schi&#781;h-mi&#781;hkasch.</p>

<p><b>Bad</b>, chi&#781;cosch: worse, chik&auml;&#781;-op&aacute;chadehsch: worst, chi&#781;k-&auml;-mi&#781;hkasch.</p>

<p><b>Near</b>, askah&aacute;: nearer, ask&aacute;-op&aacute;chad&auml;hsch: nearest (next), ask&aacute;-mihkasch.</p>

<p><b>Much</b>, hunsch: more, hun (<i>un</i> like French <i>oun</i>)-op&aacute;chad&auml;hsch: most,
hun-mi&#781;hkasch.</p>

<p><b>Old</b>, chih&oacute;sch (<i>ch</i> guttural): older, chih&auml;-op&aacute;chad&auml;hsch: oldest, chih&auml;-mi&#781;hkasch.</p>

<p><b>Sure</b> (certain), does not occur: they say instead, true, tk&uacute;schosch;
truer, tksch&auml;&#781;-opa&#781;chad&auml;sch: truest, tkuscha-mihkasch.</p>

<p><b>Great</b> (tall), h&aacute;schka: greater, h&aacute;schka-op&aacute;chad&auml;hsch: greatest,
ha&#781;schka-mi&#781;hkasch.</p>

<p><b>Wise</b>, schi&#781;rukosch: wiser, schi&#781;ruko-pa&#781;chad&auml;hsch: wisest, schi&#781;ruko-mi&#781;hkasch.</p></div>

<p>Remark. Occasionally the comparative and superlative are used
together in order to give greater emphasis.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The most beautiful river: pa&#781;ssanh&auml;(or p&aacute;ssah&auml;)-koschi&#781;-opachad&auml;h-mi&#781;hkasch.</p></div>


<h4><i>Use of Adjectives as Nouns</i></h4>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><b>The rich man</b>, ko-wak&aacute;hd&auml;-hunsch; ko, the.</p>

<p><b>The poor</b>, ko-&aacute;hchkereh-keri&#781;sch (<i>ch</i> guttural; second <i>e</i> &frac12;).</p>

<p><b>The divine</b> (godlike), m&aacute;h-choppenih-t&aacute;.</p>

<p><b>The beautiful</b>, they say "the good," ko-schi&#781;hsch.</p></div>

<p>The colors are expressed in the plural just as in German and English.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The greens (the various greens), wi&#781;hra-toh&auml;&#781;-tat&aacute;-ker&eacute;hsch; i.e.,
wi&#781;hra-toh&auml;&#781;, green; tat&aacute;, the various.</p></div>


<h4><i>Indefinite Numerals</i></h4>

<p class="center">These answer the question, how many times? or; how often?
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><b>Once</b>, schan&aacute;hre-m&aacute;chanasch.</p>

<p><b>A single one</b>, m&aacute;chana-i&#781;ncha (in the second word, <i>in</i> almost like <i>i</i>
nasal).</p>

<p><b>Twice</b>, schan&aacute;hre-nump&oacute;hsch; and so on to and including ten. First,
second, third, etc. are expressed in like manner.</p>

<p><b>Stosch</b> (with the point of the tongue), a single one.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>The Positive Degree</i></h4>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><b>That is large</b> (great): &auml;th-h&aacute;schkasch.</p>

<p><b>That is good</b>: &auml;th-schi&#781;hsch.</p>

<p><b>That is bad</b>: &auml;th-chik&oacute;sch (<i>ch</i> guttural).</p>

<p><b>That is much</b>: &auml;th-hunsch (<i>un</i> like French <i>oun</i>).</p>

<p><b>It is long</b>: h&aacute;schkasch.</p>

<p><b>It is thick</b>: cht&auml;&#781;hsch; from the word cht&auml;&#781;, thick.</p>

<p><b>It is beautiful</b>: schi&#781;hsch; from schi&#781;h, beautiful.</p></div>

<p>In these instances, therefore, <i>sch</i> is added [to form the positive].</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_258_258" id="Footnote_258_258"></a><a href="#FNanchor_258_258"><span class="label">[258]</span></a> Written from the pronunciation of the Indians themselves, especially that
of the old chief, Addi&#781;h-Hi&#781;ddisch, and with the help of the Mandans who best understood
the language. Where no exception is noted, <i>ch</i> always has the guttural sound;
<i>r</i> is always spoken with the point of the tongue. Gallatin says that the Minnitarris
consist of three tribes, of which two are the Mandans and Annahaways. I have
already refuted this statement; besides, the Mandans themselves say that they had
nothing in common with the Minnitarris, and that their language was utterly different
when they came together; in the case of the Annahaways the statement is equally
unfounded, for I could not even find this term, which no one recognized. I have
already said that the Minnitarris are a branch of the Crows. These Indians, as
well as the Mandans, have not moved their village for many years; they are, moreover,
quite safe in them, for Indians do not usually attack fortified places, especially
since the two tribes together can at any time put six hundred warriors into
the field. Neither did I find among these Indians unusually light complexions nor
blue eyes; they do not differ in this respect from the other Indians of the Missouri
valley. The legend, likewise, that the Minnitarris are a white race, descended
from the Welsh, has just as little foundation, as Gallatin has already shown (<i>ibid.</i>,
p. 125). Gallatin's words from the Minnitarri language are not correctly written,
doubtless through the fault of incompetent interpreters.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian</span>.

<p><a name="Footnote_262_262" id="Footnote_262_262"></a><a href="#FNanchor_262_262"><span class="label">[262]</span></a> Written from the pronunciation of Major Dougherty, who understood this
language perfectly. The Om&aacute;has belong to the Dac&oacute;ta linguistic group, and form
with the Osages, Konzas, Ayow&auml;s (Joways), Missouris, Otos, and Puncas, Mr.
Gallatin's southern Sioux. Among the nations named there are several different
dialects, of which the Osages and Konzas speak one; the Otos, Ayow&auml;s, and Missouris
another; and the Omahas and Puncas a third. On these peoples, see Gallatin
(<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 126-28). There it is noted that a vocabulary of the Ayow&auml;s (J&oacute;w&auml;s) is
lacking; a gap which I can claim to have filled, since I was assured by Major
Dougherty that the Ayow&auml;s speak the Oto language, whose words are given
below.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span></p></div></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_268_268" id="Footnote_268_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_268_268"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> The Snake Indians (les Serpens) call themselves Shoshon&eacute;s. They are
allies of the Flatheads, and enemies of the Blackfeet and Crows. They dwell in
the Rocky mountains and beyond, on the Columbia; they fall into two divisions&mdash;the
true Shoshon&eacute;s, and the so-called Gens de Piti&eacute;, or Radiqeurs (Root-diggers)&mdash;the
Maradi&ccedil;os of the Spaniards. The former keep a great number
of dogs, which they do not use as pack animals, but for food. They do not have
as many horses as the Blackfeet; but employ them for carrying burdens. They
live in leather tents. They are generally not so well formed as the Blackfeet;
still there are many tall, well developed men among them. Their tribe is said
to be very numerous, more so than the Dacotas. They carry on trade with the
Spaniards, who exchange beaver and other furs for leather shirts and similar
articles. They are not hostile to the whites. The Root-diggers, on the other
hand, are a wretched people. They do not have leather tents; but merely set
poles together which they cover with boughs, hay, and grass. Their physiognomy
is said to be distinguished by rather flat noses. They are very poor and barbarous,
go nearly naked, live chiefly on roots, and possess no weapons. They
eat ants in quantities; scooping up a whole hill of these, they wash them, knead
them into balls, bake these between coals, pulverize them, and then make a
soup. Mr. Campbell of Fort William, who has often visited them, gave me the
following account of them. They were so barbarous and so indifferent to their
environment, that everything about him seemed new and ridiculous to them.
At that time they did not know the value of the beaver skins, which they singed.
Some of their huts, which he visited, had remained for a long time in the same
place without their ever having looked about for a better region. He found a
large number of mountain goat skins among them; and, as they were so little
acquainted with the whites, it was possible to carry on a very profitable trade
with them. The Comanches, who call themselves Jamparicka, are said to speak
practically the same language as the Snake Indians. They live at the sources of
the Rio Colorado (Rivi&egrave;re rouge). They decorate one arm of their shirts with
tufts of hair, the other with feathers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span>

<h3>INDIAN SIGN LANGUAGE<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></h3>


<p>This sign language has been treated in various works. Say has given
noteworthy vocabularies in Edward James's <i>Account of the Expedition
of Major Long to the Rocky Mountains</i>. The Arikkaras, Mandans,
Minnitarris, Crows, Chayennes, Snakes, and Blackfeet all understand a
system of signs, which, as we were told, are unintelligible to the Dacotas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Assiniboins, Ojibuas, Krihs, and other nations. The following vocabulary
is taken from the first group.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[From Colonel Garrick Mallery's "Sign Language of the Indians of the Upper Missouri in 1832."]</p></div>

<p>Although nearly every book of travels among the Indians found between
the Alleghenies and the western slope of the Rocky Mountains,
refers to their frequent and convenient use of sign language, there are
only three useful collections of described signs of any early date, either
printed, or, so far as ascertained, in manuscript. These are as follows:<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The one collected by Prince Maximilian von Wied-Neu-Wied, in
1832-34, from the Cheyenne, Shoshoni, Arikara, Satsika, and the Absaroki,
the Mandans, Hidatsa, and other Northern Dakotas.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> This
list is not published in the English edition, but appears in the German,
Coblenz, 1839, and in the French, Paris, 1840. Bibliographic reference
is often made to this distinguished explorer as "Prince Maximilian,"
as if there were but one possessor of that christian name among princely
families. No translation of this list into English appears to have been
printed in any shape, while the German and French editions are costly
and difficult of access, so the collection cannot readily be compared by
observers with the signs now made by the same tribes. The translation
now presented is intended to facilitate such comparison. It is based
upon the German original, but in a few cases where the language was
so curt as not to give a clear idea, was collated with the French edition
of the succeeding year, which, from some internal evidence, appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>have been published with the assistance or supervision of the author.
Many of the descriptions are, however, so brief and indefinite in both
their German and French forms, that they necessarily remain so in the
present translation. The princely explorer, with the keen discrimination
shown in all his work, doubtless observed what has escaped many recent
reporters of aboriginal signs, that the latter depend much more upon
motion than mere position&mdash;and are generally large and free&mdash;seldom
minute. His object was to express the general effect of the motion,
rather than to describe it so as to allow of its accurate reproduction
by a reader who had never seen it. For the latter purpose, now very
desirable, a more elaborate description would have been necessary, and
even that would not in all cases have been sufficient without pictorial
illustration. In a few instances the present writer has added explanations
preceded by a dash&mdash;. Remarks on the signs might be indefinitely
extended, but the present object is to assist present observers in
making their own comparisons and suggestions, which, it is hoped,
they will contribute to the final work on Sign Language, now in preparation
by the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, of
which notice has been given in a preliminary pamphlet lately issued.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the distinguished explorer, who was the earliest
to publish a comprehensive and scientific account of the tribes of the
upper Missouri, is the only printed authority agreeing with the present
writer in denying the existence of a universal sign language among the
several tribes, in the sense of a common code, the report of which has
generally been accepted without question. He states that the signs
described, gathered by him from the tribes above mentioned, are unintelligible
to the Dakotas (probably Sioux), Assiniboins, Ojibwas, Krees,
and other nations. He undoubtedly means, however, that different
signs prevailed among the two bodies of Indians, so divided by himself,
and that the individuals who had only learned by rote one set of those
signs, would not understand the other set which they had never seen,
unless they were accomplished in the gesture speech as an art, and not
as a mere memorized list of arbitrary motions. It has been clearly
ascertained that two Indians of different tribes who have neither oral
language nor previously adopted signs in common, can, after a short
trial, communicate through familiarity with the principles of gesture
speech, signs being mutually invented and accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The philosophic prince also was one of the first to correct another
common error, in attributing the use of signs to the poverty of the aboriginal
tongues.</p>


<h4><i>List of the Prince of Wied-Neu-Wied</i></h4>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><b>1. Good</b>: Place the right hand horizontally in front of the breast, and
move it forward.&mdash;This gesture is more fully described by a recent
observer, as follows: "Place the right hand horizontally in front
of the breast, and touching it, fingers and thumbs closed and extended,
back of hand up, move rather sharply to the front until the
forearm is nearly extended." It may convey the suggestion of
"level," "no difficulty," and resembles some signs for "content."
Many Indians and deaf mutes use gestures to express a pleasant
taste in the mouth, for "good" even in a moral sense. (G. S. 124;
S. L. 25.)</p>

<p><b>2. Bad</b>: Close the hand and open it whilst passing it downwards.&mdash;This
sign is still frequent, the idea of dropping out the supposed
contents of the hand as not worth keeping, being obvious. (G. S. 27;
S. L. 26.)</p>

<p><b>3. See</b>: Pass the extended index-finger forward from the eye. (G. S.
229.)</p>

<p><b>4. Come</b>: Elevate the index-finger near the face, extend the hand and
return it with a number of gentle jerks.&mdash;In the prevalent sign
noticed now for "come," in the sense of "come here," the index,
after the forearm (not hand alone) is extended, is crooked slightly
as if hooking on to an object, and drawn sharply toward the person.
The degree of motion is, however, proportioned to the occasion,
and the successive "gentle jerks" of the author indicate less urgency
than one sharp redrawal. (G. S. 68.)</p>

<p><b>5. Arrive</b>: Clap the hands, elevating the index-finger of the right hand.&mdash;To
express arrival at a place indicated by previous gestures, some
of the upper Missouri tribes now hold the left hand fingers extended
and closed, well out in front of the body, palm toward it, forearm
horizontal, right hand between left and body, index extended
vertically, other fingers and thumb closed, nails outward, then the
right hand is carried sharply out until it strikes the left. The same
sign is used in a direction to go to a place indicated, and that for
returning from a place is the same with reversed position of hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
It is conjectured that the clapping of the hands mentioned by the
author as commencing the sign refers to the accomplishment of the
motion, as southern negroes say "done come." (G. S. 70.)</p>

<p><b>6. Go, depart</b>: Like <i>come</i>; but begin near the face and extend the
hand with a number of gentle jerks. (G. S. 120.)</p>

<p><b>7. Speak</b>: Place the flat hand back downward before the mouth and
move it forward two or three times. (G. S. 245.)</p>

<p><b>8. Another speaks</b>: Place the hand in the same position, beginning
farther from the mouth, drawing it nearer and nearer. (G. S. 246.)</p>

<p><b>9. Man</b>: Elevate the index-finger and turn the hand hither and thither.&mdash;The
"turning of the hand hither and thither" probably signifies
more than the simple idea of man, and is used for "only one
man" or "a man who is alone." The finger represents the male
organ of generation, and among some tribes the finger is held erect
or crooked downward, to indicate mature or declining age. (G. S.
176.)</p>

<p><b>10. Woman</b>: Pass the palm of the extended hand downward over the
hair on the side of the head, or downward over the cheeks. (G. S.
287.)</p>

<p><b>11. Child</b>: Push the index-finger rapidly into the air then draw the
hand back downward.&mdash;The distance of the hand from the ground
when the motion ceases, indicates the height of the child referred
to. Indians often indicate the height of human beings by the hand
placed at the proper elevation, back downward, and that of inanimate
objects or animals not human by the hand held back upward.
(G. S. 54.)</p>

<p><b>12. Kill</b>: Clinch the hand and strike from above downward.&mdash;This
motion, which may be more clearly expressed as the downward
thrust of a knife held in the clinched hand, is still used by many
tribes for the general idea of "kill," and illustrates the antiquity
of the knife as a weapon. The actual employment of arrow, gun,
or club in taking life, is, however, often specified by appropriate
gesture. (G. S. 158.)</p>

<p><b>13. Arrow, To shoot an</b>: Place the tips of the fingers downward upon
the thumb, then snap them forward. (G. S. 25.)</p>

<p><b>14. Gun, Discharge of a</b>: Place both hands as in No. 13, extend the
left arm, contract the right before the face, then snap the ends of
the fingers forward. (G. S. 130.)</p>

<p><b>15. Arrow, To hit with an</b>: After the fingers have been snapped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
strike the hands together and elevate the index-finger of the right
hand. (G. S. 24.)</p>

<p><b>16. Gunshot, To hit with a</b>: After the fingers have been snapped,
strike the hands together as in No. 15. (G. S. 131.)</p>

<p><b>17. God, great spirit</b>: Blow upon the open hand, point upward with
the extended index-finger whilst turning the closed hand hither and
thither, then sweep it above the earth and allow it to drop. (G. S. 89.)</p>

<p><b>18. Medicine</b>: Stir with the right hand into the left, and afterwards
blow into the latter.&mdash;All persons familiar with Indians will understand
that the term "medicine" foolishly enough adopted by both
the French and English to express the aboriginal magic arts, has no
therapeutic significance. Very few even pretended remedies were
administered to the natives, and probably never by the professional
shaman, who worked by incantation, often pulverizing and mixing
the substances mystically used, to prevent their detection. The
same mixtures were employed in divination. The author particularly
mentions Mandan ceremonies, in which a white "medicine"
stone, as hard as pyrites, was produced by rubbing in the hand snow,
or the white feathers of a bird. The blowing away of the disease, considered
to be a malign power foreign to the body, was a common
part of the juggling performance. (G. S. 179.)</p>

<p><b>19. Gun</b>: Close the fingers against the thumb, elevate the hand and
open the fingers with a quick snap. (G. S. 129.)</p>

<p><b>20. Bow</b>: Draw the right arm back completely, as if drawing the bowstring,
whilst the left arm is extended with clinched hand. (G. S. 43.)</p>

<p><b>21. Arrow</b>: Pass the index-finger of the right hand several times across
the left arm. (G. S. 23.)</p>

<p><b>22. Arrowhead, Iron</b>: With the index-finger of the right hand, touch
the tip of the extended forefinger of the left hand several times.
(G. S. 25.)</p>

<p><b>23. Gunflint</b>: With the index-finger of the right hand cut off a piece
of the extended thumb, so that the finger is laid across the thumbnail.
(G. S. 131.)</p>

<p><b>24. Gun-screw</b>: Elevate the hand to indicate a gun, and twist the
fingers spirally around the thumb. (G. S. 131.)</p>

<p><b>25. Question</b>: Extend the open hand perpendicularly with the palm
outward, and move it from side to side several times. (G. S. 210.)</p>

<p><b>26. Gunpowder</b>: Rub the thumb and index-finger together repeatedly.
(G. S. 131.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p><b>27. Coat</b>: Separate the thumb and index-finger of each hand and pass
them downward over the sides of the body. (G. S. 61.)</p>

<p><b>28. Leggings</b>: Open the fingers as before and draw them upward along
both legs. (G. S. 166.)</p>

<p><b>29. Moccasins, shoes</b>: Raise the foot and stroke it from front to back
with the index-finger of the hand on the same side. (G. S. 232.)</p>

<p><b>30. Breechcloth</b>: Pass the flat hand from between the legs upward
toward the belly. (G. S. 48.)
<b>
31. Hat</b>: Pass the parted thumb and index-finger about both sides of
the head where the hat rests upon it. (G. S. 135.)</p>

<p><b>32. True, It is</b>: Lower the hand in front of the breast, then extend the
index-finger, raise and move it straight forward before the person.
(G. S. 273.)</p>

<p><b>33. Lie</b>: Pass the second and third finger of the right hand toward the
left side in front of the mouth.&mdash;By the expression "second and
third" finger the author means, as appears in other connections,
the index and middle finger. The idea of double tongued, two
kinds of talk, prevails now among all Indian tribes, though it is
sometimes made by one finger, the index, moved successively from
the mouth in two different directions. (G. S. 166.)</p>

<p><b>34. Know</b>: Spread the thumb and index-finger of the right hand, sweep
toward the breast, moving them forward and outward so that the
palm turns up. (G. S. 161.)</p>

<p><b>35. Do not know</b>: First place the fingers in the preceding position,
then turn the right hand upward with spread fingers so that they
point outward toward the right side. (G. S. 162.)</p>

<p><b>36. Much</b>: Move both hands toward one another and slightly upward.&mdash;This
is the formation of a "heap." (G. S. 208; S. L. 24.)
<b>
37. Little</b>: Pass the nearly closed hands several times by jerks over
one another, the right hand above. (G. S. 238.)</p>

<p><b>38. Trade</b>: Strike the extended index-finger of the right hand several
times upon that of the left. (G. S. 268.)</p>

<p><b>39. Exchange</b>: Pass both hands with extended forefingers across each
other before the breast.&mdash;In the author's mind "exchange" was
probably intended for one transaction, in which each of two articles
took the place before occupied by the other, and "trade" was intended
for a more general and systematic barter, indicated by the
repetition of strokes, in which the index-fingers mutually changed
positions. (G. S. 105.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p><b>40. Horse</b>: Place the index and third fingers of the right hand astraddle
the index-finger of the left.&mdash;By the "third" the author means
the middle finger. He counts the thumb as the first. (G. S. 144.)</p>

<p><b>41. Horse, To ride a</b>: As before stated, but with this difference, that
the right hand extends farther and the gesture is made quickly.
(G. S. 147.)</p>

<p><b>42. Dog</b>: Pass the flat hand from above downward, stopping at the
height of a dog's back. (G. S. 96; S. L. 28.)</p>

<p><b>43. Beaver</b>: With the back of the open right hand, strike the palm
of the left several times. (G. S. 32.)</p>

<p><b>44. Otter</b>: Draw the nose slightly upward with the first two fingers
of the right hand. (G. S. 194.)</p>

<p><b>45. Bison, female</b>: Curve the two forefingers, place them on the sides
of the head, and move them several times. (G. S. 40.)</p>

<p><b>46. Bison, male</b>: Place the tightly closed hands on both sides of the
head with the fingers forward. (G. S. 40.)</p>

<p><b>47. Antelope</b>: Pass the open right hand outward from the small of
the back.&mdash;This, as explained by Indians examined by the present
writer, indicates the lighter coloration upon the animal's flanks.
A Ute who could speak Spanish accompanied it with the word
<i>blanco</i>, as if recognizing that it required explanation. (G. S. 22.)</p>

<p><b>48. Sheep, bighorn</b> (<i>Ovis montana</i>): Move the hands in the direction
of the horns on the side of the head by passing them backward and
forward in the form of a half-circle. (G. S. 231.)</p>

<p><b>49. Mule</b>: Hold the open hands high beside the head, and move them
from back to front several times like wings. (G. S. 186.)</p>

<p><b>50. Elk</b> (<i>Cervus can.</i>): Stretch the arms above and along side of the
head. (G. S. 103.)</p>

<p><b>51. Deer</b>: Pass the uplifted hand to and fro several times in front of
the face. (G. S. 86; S. L. 27.)</p>

<p><b>52. Deer, black tail</b>: First make the preceding gesture, then indicate
a tail. (G. S. 88; S. L. 27.)</p>

<p><b>53. Buffalo-robe</b>: Pass both fists crossing in front of the breast, as
if wrapping one's self up. (G. S. 59.)</p>

<p><b>54. Day</b>: Place both hands at some distance in front of the breast,
apart and back downward, elevate the index-finger and move it
forward to indicate one, twice for two days, etc. When counting
on the fingers begin at the left hand. (G. S. 77; S. L. 20.)</p>

<p><b>55. Night</b>: Move both hands open and flat, that is horizontal, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
backs up and in small curves in front of the breast and over one
another.&mdash;The conception is <i>covering</i>, and consequently obscurity.
In the foregoing sign for <i>day</i> the author probably meant that the
hands, palms up, were <i>moved</i> apart, to denote openness. (G. S. 187.)</p>

<p><b>56. Sun</b>: Form a small circle with the forefingers and hold them toward
heaven. (G. S. 256.)</p>

<p><b>57. Moon</b>: Make the same sign, after having made that for night.
(G. S. 183.)</p>

<p><b>58. River</b>: Open the right hand and pass it before the mouth from
above downward. (G. S. 222.)</p>

<p><b>59. Forest</b>: Slightly spread and raise the ten fingers bringing the
hands together in front of the face, then separate them.&mdash;The
numerous trees and their branches are indicated. (G. S. 112.)</p>

<p><b>60. Mountain</b>: Raise the arm from the elbow without moving the
latter, the back of the clinched hand directed toward the front.
(G. S. 141.)</p>

<p><b>61. Prairie, plain</b>: Lay the hands flat upon their backs and move
them straight from one another in a horizontal line. (G. S. 198.)</p>

<p><b>62. Village</b>: Place the opened thumb and forefinger of each hand
opposite to each other, as if to make a circle, but leaving between
them a small interval, afterward move them from above downward
simultaneously.&mdash;The villages of the tribes with which the author
was longest resident, particularly the Mandans and Arikaras, were
surrounded by a strong, circular stockade, spaces or breaks in the
circle being left for entrance and exit. (G. S. 277.)</p>

<p><b>63. Kettle</b>: Same sign as for <i>village</i>, but is made closer to the earth.&mdash;Singularly
enough, the configuration of a common kettle (the utensil
obtained from the whites in trade being, of course, the one referred
to) is the same as that of the stockaded villages, the intervals left
between the hands representing in this case the interruption in the
circle made by the handles. The differentiation is effected by the
position closer to the earth. (G. S. 157.)</p>

<p><b>64. Lodge</b>: The same, with the addition that the finger is elevated to
indicate the number, one. (G. S. 170.)</p>

<p><b>65. Lodge, Entering a</b>: Pass the right hand in short curves under
the left, which is held a short distance forward.&mdash;The conception
is of the stooping to pass through the low entrance, which is often
covered by a common flap, and the subsequent rising when the
entrance has been accomplished. In the same tribes now, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
intention is to speak of a person entering the gesturer's own lodge,
the right hand is passed under the left and toward the body, near
which the left hand is held; if of a person entering the lodge of
another, the left hand is held further from the body and the right is
passed under it and outward. In both cases both hands are slightly
curved and compressed. (G. S. 172.)</p>

<p><b>66. Robe, Red</b>: First indicate the wrapping about the shoulders, then
rub the right cheek to indicate the red color.&mdash;The red refers to
the paint habitually used on the cheeks, not to the natural skin.
The Indians know better than to designate between each other their
natural color as red, and have been known to give the designation
<i>red man</i> to the visiting Caucasian, whose blistered skin often better
deserves the epithet, which they only apply to themselves in converse
with the conquering race that insisted upon it. (G. S. 59, 66.)</p>

<p><b>67. Robe, Green</b>: Indicate the wrapping about the shoulders, and with
the back of the left hand make the gesture of stroking grass upon
the earth. (G. S. 59, 66.)</p>

<p><b>68. Robe, Blue</b>: Indicate the wrapping, then with two fingers of the
right hand rub the back of the left.&mdash;It is conjectured that the veins
on the back of the hand are indicated. (G. S. 59, 66.)</p>

<p><b>69. Ax</b>: Cross the arms and slide the edge of the right hand held vertically,
down over the left arm. (G. S. 267.)</p>

<p><b>70. Beads, Glass</b>: Stroke the fingers of the right hand over the upper
arm of the left. (G. S. 31.)</p>

<p><b>71. Vermillion, cinnabar</b>: Rub the right cheek with the fingers of
the right hand.&mdash;The chief use of this pigment was to paint the
cheeks. (G. S. 67.)</p>

<p><b>72. Knife</b>: Cut past the mouth with the raised right hand.&mdash;This
clearly refers to the general practice of cutting off food, as much
being crammed into the mouth as can be managed and then separated
by a stroke of a knife from the remaining mass. This is
specially the case with fat entrails, the aboriginal delicacies. (G. S.
160.)</p>

<p><b>73. Fire</b>: Hold the fingers of the right hand slightly opened and upward,
and elevate the hand several times.&mdash;This portrays the forked
tongues of the flames rising. (G. S. 109.)</p>

<p><b>74. Water</b>: Same as "river."</p>

<p><b>75. Smoke</b>: Snuffle the nose and raise the fingers of both hands several
times, rubbing the fingers against each other.&mdash;The rubbing may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
indicate the former mode of obtaining fire by friction, accompanied
with smoke, which is further indicated by the wrinkled nose. (G. S.
240.)</p>

<p><b>76. Partisan</b>: First make the sign of the pipe, then open the thumb
and index-finger of the right hand, back of the hand outward, move
it forward and upward in a curve.&mdash;By the title of "partisan"
the author meant, as indeed was the common expression of the
Canadian voyageurs, a leader of an occasional or volunteer war
party. The sign is explained by his account in a different connection,
that to become recognized as a leader of such a war party,
the first act among the tribes using the sign was the consecration,
by fasting succeeded by feasting, of a medicine pipe without ornament,
which the leader of the expedition afterward bore with him
as his badge of authority, and it therefore naturally became an emblematic
sign. There may be interest in noting that the "Calendar
of the Dakota Nation" (Bulletin U. S. G. and G. Survey, vol. iii,
No. 1) gives a figure (No. 43, A. D. 1842) showing "One Feather,"
a Sioux chief, who raised in that year a large war party against the
Crows, which fact is simply denoted by his holding out, demonstratively,
an unornamented pipe. (G. S. 53.)</p>

<p><b>77. Chief</b>: Raise the index-finger of the right hand, holding it straight
upward, then turn it in a circle, and bring it straight down a little
toward the earth.&mdash;If this gesture is accurately described by the
author, its conception may be "elevated in the midst of surrounding
inferiors." In view, however, of the fact that Indians now make a
forward curve instead of a horizontal circle, the former instead of
the latter may have been intended in the curt expression. The
prevailing delineation of the superior authority of the chiefs is by
superior height, one form of which is reported as follows: Right
forearm nearly vertical, index extended, thumb and other fingers
closed, nails toward cheek and about eight inches from it. Extend
right arm vertically about eight inches; turn index as an arrow
turns in the air and bring down in front of face between the eyes
until about opposite the chin. (G. S. 51; S. L. 19.)</p>

<p><b>78. White man, American</b>: Place the open index-finger and thumb
of the right hand toward the face, then pass it to the right in front
of the forehead to indicate the hat. The fist can also be used in
same way. (G. S. 283.)</p>

<p><b>79. Negro</b>: First make the sign for white man, then rub the hair on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the right side of the head with the flat hand.&mdash;The present common
sign for "black" is to rub or touch the hair, which, among Indians,
is almost universally of that color. (G. S. 186.)</p>

<p><b>80. Fool</b>: Place the hand in front of the head, back outward, then
turn it round in a circle several times. (G. S. 112.)</p>

<p><b>81. Scalp</b>: Grasp the hair with the left hand, and with the right one
flattened cut away over the left. (G. S. 228.)</p>

<p><b>82. Content, satisfied</b>: With the raised right hand, pass with a serpentine
movement upward from the breast and face above the
head. (G. S. 119; S. L. 35.)</p>

<p><b>83. Mine, this belongs to me</b>: With the fist, pass upward in front of
the breast, then push it forward with a slight jerk. (G. S. 200.)</p>

<p><b>84. Belongs to another</b>: Pass the hand quickly before the face as
if to say, "go away," then make gesture No. 83. (G. S. 202.)</p>

<p><b>85. This does not belong to me</b>: First make gesture No. 83, then
wave the right hand quickly by and in front of the face toward the
right. (G. S. 203.)</p>

<p><b>86. Perhaps I will get it</b>: First, No. 83, then move the right hand
right and left before the face, the thumb turned toward the
face.</p>

<p><b>87. Brave</b>: Close the fists, place the left near the breast, and move
the right over the left toward the left side. (G. S. 45.)</p>

<p><b>88. Coward</b>: Point forward with the index followed by the remaining
fingers, each time that is done draw back the index.&mdash;Impossible
to keep the coward to the front. (G. S. 106; S. L. 23.)</p>

<p><b>89. Hard</b>: Open the hand, and strike against it several times with the
right (with the backs of the fingers). (G. S. 134.)</p>

<p><b>90. Soft</b>: Make gesture No. 89, then strike on the opposite side so as
to indicate the reunion. (G. S. 242.)</p>

<p><b>91. Hard, Excessively</b>: Sign No. 89, then place the left index-finger
upon the right shoulder, at the same time extend and raise the right
arm high, extending the index-finger upwards, perpendicularly.
(G. S. 135.)</p>

<p><b>92. Repeat, (a thing) often</b>: Extend the left arm, also the index-finger,
and with the latter strike the arm at regular intervals from
front backward several times. (G. S. 221.)</p>

<p><b>93. Heard, I have</b>: Open wide the thumb and index-finger of the
right hand, place them over the ear, and in this position move them
quickly past the chin and nose. (G. S. 139.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p><b>94. Listen</b>: Place the open thumb and index-finger over the right ear
and move them hither and thither. (G. S. 137.)</p>

<p><b>95. Run</b>: Lay both hands flat, palm downward, and pass the right
rapidly high and far over the left, so that the body is somewhat
raised. (G. S. 225.)</p>

<p><b>96. Slow</b>: Extend the left arm, curving the forefinger and holding it
still. The right arm does the same but is drawn back with several
short and circular movements. (G. S. 237.)</p>

<p><b>97. Fat</b>: Raise the left arm with fist closed back outward, grasp the
arm with the right hand, and rub downward thereon. (G. S. 106.)</p>

<p><b>98. Lean</b>: Hold the flattened hands toward one another before the
breast, separate them, moving all the fingers several times inward
and outward toward and from the breast. (G. S. 199.)</p>

<p><b>99. Sick</b>: Hold the hands as just stated, toward one another, bring
them, held stiff, in front of the breast, and move them forward and
backward from and to the same. (G. S. 233.)</p>

<p><b>100. Dead</b>: Hold the left hand flat over the face, back outward, and
pass with the similarly held right hand below the former, gently
striking or touching it. (G. S. 83.)</p></div>

<h2>II. ON THE ORIGIN OF THE OTOS, JOWAYS,
AND MISSOURIS: A TRADITION COMMUNICATED
BY AN OLD CHIEF TO MAJOR
BEAN, THE INDIAN AGENT</h2>


<p>Some time in the year (it was before the arrival of the Whites in
America) a large band of Indians, who call themselves Fish-eaters
(<i>Hoton-ga</i>), who inhabit the lakes, being discontented, concluded that
they would migrate to the southwest in pursuit of the buffalo, and
accordingly did so. At Lake Puant they divided, and that part which
remained, still continued their original name in Indian, but from some
cause or other the Whites called them Winnebagos. The rest, more
enterprising, still continued on the journey, until they reached the Mississippi
and the mouth of the Joway River, where they encamped on
the sand-beach and again divided, one band concluding not to go
farther, and those who still wished to go on called this band, which still
remained encamped on the sand-beach, Pa-ho-dje, or Dust-noses; but
the Whites, who first discovered them on the Joway River, called them
Joways (<i>Ayow&auml;s</i>). The rest of them continued on their direction,
and struck the Missouri at the mouth of the Grand River. Having
only two principal chiefs left, they here gave themselves the name of
Neu-ta-che, which means "those that arrive at the mouth," but were
called by the Whites the Missouris. One of their chiefs had an only
son, the other chief had a beautiful daughter, and, having both a gentle
blood, thought no harm to absent themselves for a night or two together,
which raised the anger of the unfortunate girl's father to such a pitch,
that he marshalled his band and prepared for battle. They however
settled it so far as not to come to blows, but the father of the unfortunate
son separated from the others, and continued still farther up the
Missouri, whereupon they called themselves Wagh-toch-tat-ta, and
by what means I know not they have got the name Otos. The Fish-eaters,
or the Winnebagos as we call them, still continued east of the
Mississippi in the State of Illinois. The Joways, having ceded to the
United States all their title to the lands they first settled, have moved
West of the State of Missouri, between the waters of the Missouri and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the Little Platte. The Missouris, having been unfortunate at war with
the Osages, here again separated, and a part of them live now with the
Joways, and a part with the Otos. The Otos continued still up the
Missouri until they arrived at the Big Platte, which empties into the
Missouri, when they crossed and lived some time a little above its mouth,
but of late years have resided about 80 miles (by water) from the Missouri,
on the Platte River.</p>

<h2>III. SALE OF LAND BY THE INDIANS&mdash;EXTRACT
FROM THE PUBLISHED CONTRACT</h2>


<p>This Document is headed&mdash;Andrew Jackson, President of the United
States of America, to all and singular to whom these presents shall come,
greeting; &amp;c. &amp;c. Then come thirteen articles, of which the following
is the preamble:</p>

<p>Articles of a treaty made and concluded by William Clarke, Superintendent
of Indian Affaires, and Willoughby Morgan, Colonel of the
United States 1st Regt. Infantry, commissioners on behalf of the United
States, on the one part; and the undersigned deputations of the confederated
tribes of the Sacs and Foxes; the Medawah-Kanton, Wahpacoota,
Wahpeton, and Sissetong bands or tribes of Sioux; the Omahas,
Joways, Otos, and Missouris, on the other part.</p>

<p>The said tribes being anxious to remove all causes which may hereafter
create any unfriendly feeling between them, and being also anxious
to provide other sources for supplying their wants besides those
of hunting, which they are sensible must soon entirely fail them, agree
with the United States on the following articles:</p>

<p>Article I. The said tribes cede and relinquish to the United States
for ever all their right and title to the lands lying within the following
boundaries, to wit: Beginning at the upper fork of the Demoine River,
and passing the sources of the Little Sioux and Floyd's Rivers, to the
fork of the first creek which falls into the Big Sioux, or Calumet, on
the east side; thence down said creek, and Calumet River, to the Missouri
River: thence down said Missouri River to the Missouri State
line above the Kansas; thence along said line to the northwest corner
of the said state; thence to the highlands between the water falling into
the Missouri and Desmoines, passing to said highlands along the
dividing ridge between the forks of the Grand River; thence along said
highlands or ridge separating the waters of the Missouri from those of
the Desmoines, to a point opposite the source of Boyer River, and thence
in a direct line to the upper fork of the Desmoines, the place of
beginning. But it is understood that the lands ceded and relinquished
by this treaty are to be resigned and allotted under the direction of
the President of the United States to the tribes now living thereon, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting,

<h2>IV. TREATY OF TRADE AND PEACE BETWEEN
THE AMERICAN FUR COMPANY AND
THE BLACKFEET</h2>


<p>We send greeting to all mankind! Be it known unto all nations,
that the most ancient, most illustrious, and most numerous tribes of
the red skins, lords of the soil from the banks of the great waters unto
the tops of the mountains, upon which the heavens rest, have entered
into solemn league and covenant to make, preserve, and cherish a firm
and lasting peace, that so long as the water runs, or grass grows, they
may hail each other as brethren and smoke the calumet in friendship
and security.</p>

<p>On the vigil of the feast of St. Andrew, in the year eighteen hundred
and thirty-one, the powerful and distinguished nation of Blackfeet,
Pi&euml;gan, and Blood Indians, by their ambassadors, appeared at Fort
Union, near the spot where the Yellow Stone River unites its current
with the Missouri, and in the council-chamber of the Governor Kenneth
M'Kenzie met the principal chief of all the Assiniboin nation,
the Man that holds the Knife, attended by his chiefs of council, le Brechu,
le Borgne, the Sparrow, the Bear's Arm, la Terre qui Tremble, and
l'Enfant de Medicine, when, conforming to all ancient customs and
ceremonies, and observing the due mystical signs enjoined by the grand
medicine-lodges, a treaty of peace and friendship was entered into between
the said high contracting parties, and is testified by their hands
and seals hereunto annexed, hereafter and for ever to live as brethren
of one large united happy family; and may the Great Spirit, who watcheth
over us all, approve our conduct and teach us to love one another.</p>

<h2>V. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT
FORT UNION AND FORT CLARK, ON THE
UPPER MISSOURI</h2>


<p class="center">[Condensed by Asa Currier Tilton]
</p>

<p>These observations consist of those which were made by Prince
Maximilian at Fort Clark in 1833-34, and of extracts from the records
kept at Fort Union for the two years preceding, by Mr. Mc Kenzie.
The observations were systematized by Prof. M&auml;dler, then at Dorpat,
but formerly at Berlin. His conclusions and comments are printed
in his own words.</p>

<p>A table is given of the observations at Fort Union in 1832-33. It
shows the monthly average and the daily variation of temperature.
The daily and annual variations are found to be greater than in Europe,
even in the interior of Russia; and are those of a typical continental
climate. Some variations are manifestly unusual. The period
of observation in so variable a climate is too short to reduce the figures
to a formula; but a table of the differences is given, and some of the
most marked variations and apparent exceptions are discussed.</p>

<p>The observations of the principal winds are given in another table.
Here, also, the period of observation is too short for definite results;
but more correspondence is found with Europe than in the case of
temperature. As in Europe, the north and the south winds are rarest,
the former especially.</p>

<p>Still another table shows the influence of the winds on temperature.
This is valuable in spite of the short period covered. The south wind
is found to be the warmest; and the northwest wind, followed by the
northeast, the coldest. There is too little north wind to conclude that
it is regularly as warm as the data indicate.</p>

<p>The southwest wind keeps its place throughout the year, the northwest
wind only in the autumn and winter; in the spring and summer,
the northeast wind takes its place as the coldest. For all the seasons,
the east wind corresponds most nearly to the average temperature.</p>

<p>The observations at Fort Clark are given in similar tables. From
November to the latter part of January the cold increased; the first
part of February was decidedly warmer. The winter was very cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
not alone in the Missouri valley but in the Atlantic states as well; it
was, however, one of the mildest on record in Europe.</p>

<p>The table on the winds indicates none which corresponds to the
average temperature. The northwest and west winds vary from it
but little, however. The mildest wind seems to be the southwest; while
the greatest cold seems to coincide with the northeast wind.</p>

<p>Another table gives the cloudy and clear days, and indicates their
relation to temperature. From November to the beginning of March
the clear mornings are the colder; in the latter part of March there is
no difference. In December, January, and February the clear middays
are the colder; for the rest of the time, the cloudy or neutral days
are coldest. In January, the neutral days are the warmest.</p>

ornithology, see Elliott Coues, "List of Faunal Publications relating to North
American Ornithology," being the Bibliographical Appendix to his <i>Birds of the
Colorado Valley</i> (United States Geological Survey of the Territories, <i>Misc. Pub.</i> No.
11, 1878); also his "Second Instalment of American Ornithological Bibliography,"

<p><a name="Footnote_275_275" id="Footnote_275_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275_275"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> I describe this vulture under the term <i>septentrionalis</i>, because I now regard
it as a distinct species. I am indebted to Privy Councillor Lichtenstein of Berlin
for the opportunity of examining several specimens of <i>Urubus</i> from different parts
of South America and from Mexico; and I am now convinced that they, together
with the Brazilian, form a species which is distinct from the North American. The
male of the southern red-headed <i>Urubu</i> (<i>C. aura</i>) is smaller, more uniformly dark,
with stronger metallic gloss, and with less brightly-rounded wing feathers than the
northern. In the Brazilian bird the iris is bright red, and in the mature bird the
head is sky blue and orange. In the North American bird the head is of a dirty
violet red, occasionally violet, the base of the bill lac red the iris grayish brown
with a lighter band around the pupil, and a narrow bright red band on the outer
edge. The immature birds of both species have a dirty violet head, etc. I hope
to deal more thoroughly with this subject in another place. I will remark in passing
that the statement of Schomburgk (see <i>Annals of Natural History</i>) in a natural
history of the king vulture (<i>Vultur papa l.</i>), "that the other vultures will not
eat until the king vulture has satisfied himself," is most certainly a fable.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Comment by Ed.</i> For Lichtenstein, see <i>post</i>, note 276. The Schomburgk referred
to is probably Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk, the famous explorer, and the
author of works on Guiana and the Barbadoes. A publication was started at
Edinburgh in 1837 under the title, <i>Magazine of Zoology and Botany</i>; in 1839 the
name was changed to <i>Annals of Natural History</i>, and the place of publication to
London; later, the title became <i>Annals and Magazine of Natural History</i>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_276_276" id="Footnote_276_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_276_276"><span class="label">[276]</span></a> <i>Fulica americana</i> is different from <i>atra</i>. This is shown more clearly in Wilson's
description than in that of Audubon. The latter's description of the bill
of the American bird does not agree with my observation; I have always found it
uniformly colored, as Wilson describes it. I found no birds of the genus <i>Fulica</i>
in Brazil; consequently D'Orbigny (see De la Sagra, <i>Hist. Nat. de l'Isle de
Cuba, ornith.</i>, p. 273) is in error when he says that <i>Fulica atra</i> was seen by me
in Brazil. In North America I frequently found a similar bird, as has been said;
but I cannot regard it as identical with the European. Regarding the <i>Fulica</i>
observed by D'Orbigny in South America I can give no opinion, as I saw none
myself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.</span>

<i>Comment by Ed.</i> The references are to: Alexander Wilson, <i>American Ornithology</i>
(Philadelphia, 1801-14, 9 vols.); John James Audubon, <i>Ornithological Biography</i>
(Edinburgh, 1831-39, 5 vols.), forming the text to his <i>Birds of America</i>
(London, 1827-38, 4 vols.); and to <i>Histoire physique, politique et naturelle de l'Isle
de Cuba; par M. Ramon de la Sagra ... Ornithologie par Alcide d'Orbigny</i>
(Paris, 1839, 1 vol. and atlas). Alcide Dessalines d'Orbigny was a French naturalist
who spent several years in South America, collecting natural history specimens.
An account of his journey is given in his <i>Voyages dans l'Amerique meridionale</i>
(Paris, 1834-47, 9 vols.); he also published other works.</p></div>

that I have followed the change. On this subject, see Lichtenstein, <i>Beitrag zur

beautiful species of duck; it is, however, to be criticised as not giving to the

them very accurately from life; and I hope to use this picture in another place.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maximilian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></span></p></div></div>

<h2>VIII. SYSTEMATIC VIEW OF THE PLANTS
BROUGHT BACK FROM MY TOUR ON THE
MISSOURI, DRAWN UP BY PRESIDENT
NEES VON ESSENBECK, AT BRESLAU</h2>


<h3>RANUNCULACE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Clematis cordata</i>, Pursh. &#9794;&mdash;<i>Ranunculus</i> pusillus, P.&mdash;<i>R.</i> repens, L.
var. laciniis foliorum acuminatis, petiolis pedunculisque hirsutis, major
et minor.</p>

<p><i>Anemone Pensylvanica</i>, L.&mdash;<i>Aquilegia Canadensis</i>, L.&mdash;<i>Delphinium
azureum</i>, Mich.&mdash;<i>Thalictrum anemonoides</i>, De C.</p>

<p><i>Hydrastis Canadensis</i>, L. (The very bitter root-stock of this plant
contains a beautiful yellow dye, and is used in America as a medicine).</p>


<h3>CRUCIFER&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Sisymbryum brachycarcum</i>, Richards. An S. canescentis, Nutt. var.
glabriuscula? Confer S. Sophia, Pursh.</p>

<p><i>Nasturtium sylvestre</i>, De C. (The American plant has larger leaves
than the German).&mdash;<i>Stannleya pinnatifida</i>, Nutt.</p>

<p><i>Vesicaria Ludoviciana</i>, De C. (Alyssum Ludovicianum, Nutt.; Myagrum
argenteum, Pursh.)</p>

<p><i>Erysimum asperum</i>, De C. (Er. lanceolatum, Pursh.; Cheiranthus
asper, Nutt.)</p>

<p><i>Alyssum dentatum</i>, Nutt. Flores Nuttalio et Candollio huc usque erant
ignoti.&mdash;<i>Dentaria laciniata</i>, Mich.</p>


<h3>FUMARIACE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Diclytra cucullaria</i>, De C.&mdash;<i>Corydalis aurea</i>, Willd.&mdash;<i>C. flavula</i>, Raf.</p>


<h3>PAPAVERACE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Sanguinaria Canadensis</i>, L. (A celebrated medicine plant.)</p>


<h3>CAPPARIDE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Peritoma serrulatum</i>, De C. (Cleome serrulata, Pursh.)</p>


<h3>VIOLARIACE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Viola Canadensis</i>, Pursh&mdash;<i>V. pubescens</i>, Nutt.&mdash;<i>V. sagittata</i>, Ait.&mdash;<i>V.
villosa</i>, Ell.&mdash;<i>V. cucullata</i>, Ell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>


<h3>POLYGALE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Polygala alba</i>, Nutt. Torrey in Ann. Lyc. Novebor II. p. 168. The
root is quite the same as that of the officinal Radix seneg&aelig;.</p>


<h3>LINE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Linum rigidum</i>, Pursh? Agrees indeed, in many particulars, but the
petals are not narrow (angustissima), but obovate, longer than the
calyx; the lower leaves of the stalk are opposite, very small, and
linear-spatulate, 1-1&frac12; lines long. The sepals are beautifully ciliated,
with glandular teeth.</p>

<p><i>Linum</i> (<i>Adenoblepharum</i>) <i>annuum</i>, foliolis calycinis ovato-lanceolatis
acuminatis trinervibus glanduloso-ciliatis, petalis obovatis, foliis
rigide erectis linearibus, inferioribus brevissimis obtusis suboppositis.</p>

<p><i>Linum Lewisii</i>, Pursh. Vix idem ac L. sibiricum, De C. Flores sunt
minores.</p>


<h3>MALVACE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Cristaria coccinea</i>, Pursh. (Sida? coccinea, De C.; Malva coccinea,
Nutt.) Seems to form a distinct genus, but I found no perfect fruit
to determine the character.</p>


<h3>RHAMNE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Rhamnus alnifolius</i>, var. foliis minoribus.</p>


<h3>ACERIN&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Acer saccharinum, L.</i></p>


<h3>AMPELIDE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Vitis cordifolia</i>, Michx. and (probably) Vitis riparea, Michx.</p>


<h3>OXALIDE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Oxalis violacea</i>, L. Styli hirti.</p>


<h3>TEREBINTHACE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Rhus Toxicodendron</i>, L.&mdash;<i>R. aromatica</i>, L.&mdash;<i>Zanthoxylum fraxineum</i>, W.</p>


<h3>LEGUMINOSE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Sophora</i> (<i>Pseudosophora</i>, De C.) <i>sericea</i>, Nutt. Torr. in Ann. Lyc.
Novebor, p. 174, n. 65. Our specimen is entirely covered with white
appressed hairs, which cover also the upper side of the leaves; the
flowers are white; the calyx is gibbous below, and quinquefid; the
upper teeth are broader and rather shorter. Of the 10 stamina every
2-3 are united at the bottom by the thick filaments; the two upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
ones are more slender, and quite free. The ovary is covered with
silky hairs; the claw of the standard is very stiff; the keel runs into
a narrow point, as in Oxytropis.</p>

<p><i>Thermopsis rhombifolia</i>, De C. (Thermea rhombifolia, Nutt.; Cytisus
rhombifolius, Pursh.)</p>

<p><i>Petalostemum violaceum</i>, Mich., var. foliis plerisque ternatis.</p>

<p><i>Petalostemum virgatum</i>, nob. P. spicis cylindricis compactis, bracteis
scariosis obovatis cuspidulatis calyce paulo brevioribus, calycibus
glabris sulcatis dentibus ciliatis, foliolis subtrijugis lanceolato-oblongis
glabris, caule ramoso virgato ramis monostachyis.</p>

<p>Intermediate, between the two divisions of this genus, the proper
Petalanther&aelig; and Kuhnister&aelig;. The perfectly spiked inflorescence connects
it with the former; the nature of the bracte&aelig; and the cili&aelig; of the
shorter teeth join it to the latter. From the two white flowering Petalostemones
P. candidum and macrostachyum, it is sufficiently distinguished
by the two short bracte&aelig;, quite hidden under the flowers; it
cannot be more closely connected with Petalostemum corymbosum,
because of the spiked inflorescence.</p>

<p><i>Psoralea incana</i>, Nutt. (Ps. argophylla, Pursh.) Folia in nostra quinata,
summa ternata.</p>

<p><i>Psoralea tenuiflora</i>, Pursh? Foliola ternata, oblongo-lanceolata, mucronata.
Legumen ovatum, in rostrum attenuatum, glandulosoexasperatum,
calyce longius. Flores c&#339;rulei. An nov. sp.? Quite
the form of an amorpha, but the flowers appear like those of glycyrrhiza;
unfortunately it cannot be accurately examined.</p>

<p><i>Amorpha nana</i>, Nutt. De C. (A. microphylla, Pursh.) Calyx glaber
dentibus ciliatis.&mdash;<i>Oxytropis Lamberti</i>, Pursh.</p>

<p><i>Astragalus Missurensis</i>, Nutt. An cum A. Hypoglotti conjungendus?&mdash;<i>Astragalus
racemosus</i>, Pursh. Var. foliolis foliorum inferiorum
ovalibus.</p>

<p><i>Astragalus gracilis</i>, Nutt. Torr. l. c. p. 179. This is indisputably the
Dalea parviflora, Pursh, but whether really his Astragalus tenellus,
I doubt.&mdash;<i>Astragalus Carolinianus</i>, L.</p>

<p><i>Lathyrus polymorphus</i>, Nutt. De C. Torr. in Ann. Lyc. Novebor. II.
p. 180, n. 99. (Lathyrus decaphyllus et Vicia stipulacea, Pursh.)&mdash;<i>Vicia
Americana</i>, L.</p>

<p><i>Vicia Americana &#946; angustifolia</i>; foliolis oblongo-linearibus mucronatis
pubescentibus. An distincta species?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>


<h3>FRAXINE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Fraxinus platycarpa</i>.</p>


<h3>ROSACE&AElig;</h3>

<p><i>Rubus trivialis</i>, Michx. Diagnosi adde: caule primario glabro angulato
aculeis sparsis rectis aut sursum falcatis (!), foliis supra pilosis subtus
molliter pubescentibus, ramulis petiolis pedunculisque villosis et
aculeis retrorsum curvatis armatis, corymbis in ramulis terminalibus
simplicibus, sepalis ovatis brevicuspidatis. Rubus trivialis perperam
ab aliis ad R. hispidum Linn. refertur. An Rubus argutus Link.
Enum. hujus cenostri synonymon? (Dewberries incol.) <i>Potentilla
supina, L.</i>&mdash;<i>Fragaria elatior</i>, Ehrh.</p>

<p><i>Rosa</i>. A species of the division of the Cinnamome&aelig;, Ser., or Linkian&aelig;,
Trattin; allied to the Rosa Woodsii and Rosa Americana; it may
also be compared with Rosa obovata, Raf.; but it is very probably a
good new species, which may be so characterized:</p>

<p><i>Rosa Maximiliani</i>, N. ab. E. tubo ovarii subgloboso (ante anthesin
ovato), pedunculis petiolisque inermibus et glabris, foliis solitariis,
aculeis stipularibus subfalcatis, stipulis subovatis planis denticulatis
a foliolis inferioribus distantibus, laciniis calycinis ternis margine setis
exiguis appendiculatis, foliolis glabris ovalibus obtusis basi cuneiformibus
integerrimis a medio dense incurvo-serratis. The flowers
are large, red, with emarginate petals; the sepals are shorter than
the petals, a little broader at the apex, and downy above; the ripe
fruit is conical and crowned; the peduncles are red and slender; the
leaflets bi-or trijugated, small, bluish-green below, quite smooth,
without prickles, the lowest pair smaller; the stalk is red, and seems
to have been furrowed when alive; the prickles are nearly opposite
each other.</p>

<p><i>Rosa</i> (<i>Cinnamomea</i>) <i>obovata</i> Rafinesque? Differt specimen nostrum:
floribus sub-corymbosis nec solitariis, et fructibus vix subgloboso-depressis,
sed potius subglobosis. Var. floribus albis. Authors have
indeed this species under R. cinnamomea, but this is certainly wrong.</p>

<p><i>Rosa Carolina</i>? cum fructibus absque flore.&mdash;<i>Amelanchier sanguinea</i>,
De C. (Pyrus sanguinea, Pursh.)</p>

<p><i>Crat&aelig;gus coccinea</i>, Lin.&mdash;<i>Prunus serotina</i>, Ehrh.&mdash;<i>Cerasus pygm&#339;a</i>,

<p>Kuhnia suaveolens, Fres. in En. Sem. horti Francofurtensis anno
1838.</p>

<p>Habitat in sylvis, frutetis et in collibus ad Missouri fluvium superiorem

<p>Differt evidenter a Kuhnia eupatorioide: foliis saltem superioribus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
plerisque, haud petiolatis sed basi parum angustiori sessilibus, inferioribus

subtus, glandulis micantibus inspersa, corymbo plurifloro magis patula,
involucri foliolis inferioribus valde decrescentibus anguste linearibus
laxe patulis. Coroll&aelig; alb&aelig;. Involucri foliola superiora oblongo

<p>Variat foliis caulinis modo magis modo minus serratis, quandoque

<p><i>Senecio ceratophyllus</i>, N. ab E.</p>

<p>S. foliis oblongis, inferioribus lyrato-pinnatipartitis superioribus
pinnatipartitis petiolatis cauleque lanuginosis, laciniis acuminatis
extrorsum inciso-dentatis, dentibus angustis, petiolis auriculatis
amplexicaulibus, floribus umbellatis, pedunculis elongatis nudis.</p>

<p>On the Upper Missouri, June 13.</p>

<p>Nearly related to Senecio balsamit&aelig;, but sufficiently different, as
I was convinced by specimens which I received through Mr. Gray,
from New York. The plant of the Missouri is much larger, 1&frac12;-2
feet high, entirely covered with loose downy hair. The lowest leaves
are not entire, but lyrate and pinnatified below to the mid-rib,
with a terminal lobe. The lacini&aelig; and the terminal lobe have long,
narrow, pointed teeth; the middle leaves are of the same shape;
the ultimate lobe is, however, narrower, and shows the transition
to the upper, entirely pinnatified leaves. The lacini&aelig; of these upper
leaves are nearly lanceolate, and have, above and below, two or
three teeth, but at the middle only one or no tooth. The petiole
is long, and the auricles distant from the lower lacini&aelig;. In Senecio
balsamit&aelig; the cauline leaves are sessile; these too, have here,
only blunt teeth; the receptacles are twice as large as in Senecio balsamit&aelig;,
and the scales of the involucrum are very pointed. In
Senecio balsamit&aelig;, on the contrary, they are much less pointed, and
may often be designated as obtuse.</p>

<p><i>Artemisia Douglassiana</i>, Bess. Abr. n. 39. Hook. Fl. Am. bor. p. 323.

exterioribus brevioribus. Fruticulus foliis alternis pinnatisectis, laciniis
spinuloso-setigeris.</p>

<p>This genus is next to Aplopappus, Cass., from which it is distinguished,
besides the habit, by the unequal pappus, and by the scales
of the involucrum below the mucro, which are herbaceous, and
marked with glandular swellings. From this last character we might
be inclined to connect it with Clomenocoma, Cass.; but this genus
is sufficiently distinguished by the truncated bearded branches of the
style. Our genus is more nearly allied to Sommerfeltia, Less., and
almost the only difference is in the fertile florets of the disk, which in
the other are barren.</p>

<p>This shrub has some similarity with Ceratiola ericoides, and may
have been overlooked on that account. As we are still unacquainted

<p><i>Sesleria dactyloides</i>, Nutt. Deserves to form a distinct species, which
belongs to the Chloride&aelig;, and from the habit should be placed next
to Chondrosium. Two peduncles mostly come out of the upper sheath;
some leaves are biennial. The unilateral spikes are hardly half an
inch long, oval, and often tinged with violet on the back. The lower
valve of the calyx turned to the rhachis is more than twice as small as
the upper. I always found only two flowers; the upper one stalked;
both similarly formed, with triple-nerved lower valve, which terminates
in a short point; the upper valve is ciliated. The scales are
smooth, nearly quadrate, obtusely crenated. Three stamina with
yellow anthers. In many flowers the pistil is entirely wanting, and
the plant is perhaps di&#339;cious.</p>

excurrente, inferioribus arete complicatis obliquis, capsulis ovalibus
heteromallis subsessilibus perich&aelig;tio longissimo immersis, dentibus
peristomii interioris longis persistentibus coloratis apice incurvis.</p>

<p>In ramis fruticum inundatis ad flumina Wabash, Fox and Black
Rivers. Decembre cum fructu maturo.</p>

<p>Differs from Chryph&aelig;a heteromalla, not only by the long, slender
stems, and the thick projecting nerve of the leaves, but most especially
by the stiff red cili&aelig; of the inner peristome, which almost exceed the
exterior ones in length, and are incurved inwards at the point. The
lower cauline leaves are so broken that the two halves touch with
their upper surface, and the leaf acquires almost an ensiform appearance.
The leaves of the involucrum are quite nerveless. The capsule
is yellow. I did not see the operculum and the hood.</p>


<h3>LICHENES</h3>

<p><i>Usnea hirta</i>, Ach.&mdash;<i>Parmelia tiliacea</i>, Ach.</p>
